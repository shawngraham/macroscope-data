SWP No. 5.1(Examination of Nehemiah Abbott Jr. )[April 22 1692]The examination of Nehemiah Abbot  at a court at Salem village  by John Hawthorne and Jonathan Corwin Esqrs. 22nd April 1692 .What say you are you guilty of witchcraft of which you are sus-  pected or not? No Sir I say before God before whom I stand that  I know nothing of witchcraft. Who is this man? Ann Putman named  him. -- Mary Walcot said she had seen his shape. What do you say to  this? I never did hurt them. Who hurt you Ann Putman ? That man.  I never hurt her. Ann Putman said he is upon the beam. Just such a  discovery of the person carried out and she confessed; and if you  would find mercy of God you must confess. -- If I should confess  this I must confess what is false. Tell how far you have gone who  hurts you? I do not know I am absolutely free. As you say God  knows. If you will confess the truth we desire nothing else that you  may not hide you guilt if you are guilty and therefore confess if so.  I speak before God that I am clear from this accusation. What in all  respects? Yes in all respects. Doth this man hurt you? Their mouths  were stopped. You hear several accuse you though one cannot open  her mouth. I am altogether free. Charge him not unless it be he. This  is the man say some and some say he is very like him. How did you  know his name? He did not tell me himself but other witches told  me. Ann Putman said it is the same man and then she was taken with  a fit. Mary Walcot  is this the man? He is like him I cannot say it is  he. Mercy Lewis said it is not the man. They all agreed the man had  a bunch on his eyes. Ann Putman  in a fit said be you the man? ay  do you say you be the man? did you put a mist before my eyes?  Then he was sent forth till several others were examined. When he was  brought in again by reason of much people and many in the win-  dows so that the accusers could not have a clear view of him he was   ordered to be abroad and the accusers to go forth to him and view  him in the light which they did and in the presence of the magis-  trates and many others discoursed quietly with him one and all  acquitting him but yet said he was like that man but he had not the  wen they saw in his apparition Note he was a hilly faced man and  stood shaded by reason of his own hair so that for a time he seemed  to some by-standers and observers to be considerably like the person  the afflicted did describe.Mr. Samuel Parris  being desired to take in writing the examina-  tion of Nehemiah Abbot  hath delivered it as aforesaid and upon  hearing the same did see cause to dismiss him.John Hawthorne Jona.

SWP No. 6.2(Examination of John Alden as Published by Robert Calef)[May 31 1692 ]John Aldin Senior  of Boston in the County of Suffolk Mariner on the 28th Day of May 1692 was sent for by the Magistrates of Salem in the County of Essex upon the Accusation of a  company of poor distracted or possessed Creatures or Witches;  and being sent by Mr. Stoughton  arrived there the 31st of May  and appeared at Salem-Village before Mr. Gidney  Mr. Hathorn  and Mr. Curwin.Those Wenches being present who plaid their jugling tricks  falling down crying out and staring in Peoples Faces; the Magi-  strates demanded of them several times who it was of all the People  in the Room that hurt them? one of these Accusers pointed several  times at one Captain Hill  there present but spake nothing; the  same Accuser had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he  stooped down to her Ear then she cried out Aldin  Aldin afflicted  her; one of the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Aldin   she answered no he asked her how she knew it was Aldin ? She  said the Man told her so.Then all were ordered to go down into the Street where a Ring  was made; and the same Accuser cried out “there stands Aldin  a  bold fellow with his Hat on before the Judges he sells Powder and  Shot to the Indians and French and lies with the Indian Squaes  and has Indian Papooses.” Then was Aldin committed to the Marshal's  Custody and his Sword taken from him; for they said he afflicted  them with his Sword. After some hours Aldin was sent for to the  Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required  Aldin to stand upon a Chair to the open view of all the People.The Accusers cried out that Aldin did pinch them then when  he stood upon the Chair in the sight of all the People a good way  distant from them one of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold  open Aldin's hands that he might not pinch those Creatures. Aldin  asked them why they should think that he should come to that  Village to afflict those persons that he never knew or saw before?  Mr. Gidney bid Aldin confess and give glory to God; Aldin said he hoped he should give glory to God and hoped he should never gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him if they ever suspected him to be such a person and challenged any one that could bring in any thing upon their own knowledge that might give suspicion of his being such an one. Mr. Gidney said he had known Aldin many Years and had been at Sea with him and al-  ways look'd upon him to be an honest Man but now he did see cause  to alter his judgment: Aldin answered he was sorry for that but he hoped God would clear up his Innocency that he would recall  that judgment again and added that he hoped that he should with  Job maintain his Integrity till he died. They bid Aldin look upon the Accusers which he did and then they fell down. Aldin asked  Mr. Gidney what Reason there could be given why Aldin's looking  upon him did not strike him  down as well; but no reason was given  that I heard. But the Accusers were brought to Aldin to touch them and this touch they said made them well. Aldin began to speak of the Providence of God in suffering these Creatures to accuse Innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked Aldin why he would offer to speak of the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said Mr. Noyes ) governs the World and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse and stopt Aldin's mouth as to that. Aldin told Mr. Gidney that he could assure him that there was a lying Spirit in them for I  can assure you that there is not a word of truth in all these say of me. But Aldin was again committed to the Marshal and his Mittimus  written which was as follows.  To Boston Aldin was carried by a Constable no Bail would be taken for him; but was delivered to the Prison-keeper where he remained Fifteen Weeks; and then observing the manner of Tryals and Evidence then taken was at length prevailed with to make his Escape and being returned was bound over to Answer at the Superiour Court at Boston the last Tuesday in AprilAnno 1693. And was there cleared by Proclamation none appearing against him.                                                          Per. John Aldin.( Robert Calef.

And now I hope God  in some measure has made me something sensible of my sin and apostasy begging pardon of God and of the Honourable Magistrates and  all Gods people hoping and promising by the help of God to set to  my heart and hand to do what in me lyeth to destroy such wicked  worship humbly begging the prayers of all Gods People for me I  may walk humbly under this great affliction and that I may procure to my self the sure mercies of David and the blessing of Abraham.(John Hale.

SWP No. 14.1(Deposition of the Rev. John Hale v. Sarah Bishop )[May 20 1692 ]John Hale of Beverly aged about 56 yeares [torn] & saith that  about 5 or 6 years ago e Christian the wife of John Trask (living in  Salem bounds bordering on the abovesaid Beverly) beeing in full  comunion in o'r Church came to me to [de] sier that Goodwife Bishop her Neighb'r wife of Edw: Bishop Jun'r might not be permitted  to receive the Lords Supper in our church till she had given her the  said Trask satisfaction for some offences that were against her.viz because the said Bishop did entertaine people in her house at unseasonable houres in the night to keep drinking and playing at shovel-board  whereby discord did arise in other families & young people were in  danger to bee corrupted & that the s'd Trask knew these things  & had once gon into the house & fynding some at shovel-board had  taken the peices thay played with & thrown them into the fyre  & had reprooved the said Bishop for promoting such disorders But received no satisfaction from her about it.I gave s'd Christian Trask direction how to proceed farther in  this matter if it were clearly prooved And indeed by the information  I have had otherwise I doe fear that if a stop had not been putt to  those disorders s'd Edw. Bishop's house would have been a house of  great prophainness & iniquity.But as to Christian Trask the next news I heard of her was that  she was distracted & asking her husband Trask when she was so taken [he told] mee shee was taken distracted that night after shee [came  from] my house when shee complained against Goody Bishop. She continueing some time Distracted wee sought the Lord by fasting & prayer & the Lord was pleased to restore the s'd [Trask]  to the use of her reason agen. I was s'th her often in [her] distraction  (& took it then to bee only distraction yet fearing sometimes  somw't worse) but since I have seen the fitts of those bewitched at  Salem Village I call to mind some of hers to be much like some of theirs.The said Trask when recovered as I understood it did manifest  strong suspicion that shee had been bewitched by the s'd Bishop's  wife & showed so much aversness from having any conversation that  I was then troubled at it hopeing better of s'd Goody Bishop at that  time for wee have since [torn] At length s'd Christian Trask [was]  agen in a distracted fit on a Sabboth day in the forenoon at the publ[i]ck meeting to o'r public desturbance & so continued sometimes  better sometimes worse unto her death manifesting that shee under  temptation to kill her selfe or somebody else. I enquired of Marg'rt Ring who kept at or nigh the house what  shee had observed of s'd Trask before this last distraction shee told  [mee.] Goody Trask was much given to reading & search the prophecys of scrip[ture]. The day before shee made that disturbance in the meeting [house  she[e] came home & said shee had been w'th Goody Bishop & that  they two were now friend or to that effect.I was oft praying w'th & councelling of Goody Trask before her  death and not many days before her end being there shee seemed  more rationall & earnestly desired Edw: Bishop might be sent for  that shee might make friends with him I asked her if shee had  wronged Edw. Bishop shee said not that shee knew of unless it were  in taking his shovel-board pieces when people were at play w'th them  & throwing them into the fyre & if she did evill in it she was very  sorry for it & desiered he would be friends with her or forgive her.  this was the very day before she dyed or a few days before. Her distraction (or bewitching) continued about a month and in  those intervalls wherein shee was better shee earnestly desired prayers  & the Sabboth befere she dyed I received a note for prayers on her  behalf w'ch her husband said was written by her selfe & I judge was  her owne hand writing beeing well acquainted with her hand.As to the wounds she dyed of I observed 3 deadly ones; apeice  of her wind pipe cutt out. & another wound above that threww the   windpipe & Gullet & the veine they call jugular. So that I then judge  & still doe apprehend it impossible for her w'th so short a pair of  cissars to mangle her selfe so without some extraordinary work of  the devill or witchcraftsigned. 20. may 1692  by *John Hale.

A.  Ever since I was six years old. Q. How old are you now? A. Near  eight years old brother Richard says I shall be eight years old in  November next. Q. Who made you a witch? A. My mother she  made me set my hand to a book. Q. How did you set your hand to  it? A. I touched it with my fingers and the book was red the paper   of it was white. She said she never had seen the black man; the place  where she did it was in Andrew Foster's pasture and Elizabeth Johnson junr. was there. Being asked who was there beside she answered  her Aunt Toothaker and her cousin. Being asked when it was she  said when she was baptized. Q. What did they promise to give you?  A. A black dog. Q. Did the dog ever come to you? A. No. Q. But  you said you saw a cat once. What did that say to you? A. It said  it would tear me in pieces if I would not set my hand to the book.  She said her mother baptized her and the devil or black man was  not there as she saw and her mother said when she baptized her  thou are mine for ever and ever and amen. Q. How did you afflict  folks? A. I pinched them and she said she had no puppets but  she went to them that she afflicted. Being asked whether she went in  her body or her spirit she said in her spirit. She said her mother  carried her thither to afflict. Q. How did your mother carry you  when she was in prison? A. She came like a black cat. Q. How did  you know that it was your mother? A. The cat told me so that she  was my mother. She said she afflicted Phelp's child last saturday  and Elizabeth Johnson joined with her to do it. She had a wooden  spear about as long as her finger of Elizabeth Johnson and she had  it of the devil. She would not own that she had ever been at the  witch meeting at the village.

SWP No. 29.2( Examination of Elizabeth Cary as Published by Robert Calef )[++ May 23 1692]I having heard some days that my Wife was accused of Witch-  craft being much disturbed at it by advice we went to Salem-  Village to see if the afflicted did know her; we arrived there 24 May it happened to be a day appointed for Examination; accord-  ingly soon after our arrival Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin  etc. went  to the Meeting-house which was the place appointed for that Work  the Minister began with Prayer and having taken care to get a  convenient place I observed that the afflicted were two Girls of  about Ten Years old and about two or three other of about eighteen one of the Girls talked most and could discern more than the  rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one and as they came in  were cried out of etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot  from the Justices and the Accusers between the Justices and them;  the Prisoner was ordered to stand right before the Justices with an Officer appointed to hold each hand least they should therewith  afflict them and the Prisoners Eyes must be constantly on the Justices; for if they look'd on the afflicted they would either fall into their Fits or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of  the Prisoners who it was afflicted these Girls etc. they were put upon saying the Lords Prayer as a tryal of their guilt; after the  afflicted seem'd to be out of their Fits they would look steadfastly on some one person and frequently not speak; and then the Justices  said they were struck dumb and after a little time would speak again;  then the Justices said to the Accusers “which of you will go and  touch the Prisoner at the Bar?” then the most couragious would ad-  venture but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall  down as in a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up  and carried to the Prisoner that she might touch them; and as soon  as they were touched by the accused the Justices would say they are  well before I could discern any alteration; by which I observed that  the Justices understood the manner of it. Thus far I was only as  a Spectator my Wife also was there part of the time but no notice  taken of her by the afflicted except once or twice they came to her  and asked her name.But I having an opportunity to Discourse Mr. Hale (with whom  I had formerly acquaintance) I took his advice what I had best to do and desired of him that I might have an opportunity to speak  with her that accused my Wife; which he promised should be I  acquainting him that I reposed my trust in him.Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over  and told me I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser  viz . Abigail Williams  a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old; but that we could  not be in private at Mr. Parris's House as he had promised me; we  went therefore into the Alehouse where an Indian Man attended us who it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder he shewed several Scars that seemed as if they had been long there  and shewed them as done by Witchcraft and acquainted us that his  Wife who also was a Slave was imprison'd for Witchcraft. And now  instead of one Accuser they all came in who began to tumble down  like Swine and then three Women were called in to attend them.  We in the Room were all at a stand to see who they would cry  out of; but in a short time they cried out Cary ; and immediately after a Warrant was sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before  them who were sitting in a Chamber near by waiting for this.Being brought before the Justices her chief accusers were two Girls; my Wife declared to the Justices that she never had any knowledge of them before that day; she was forced to stand with her  Arms stretched out. I did request that I might hold one of her  hands but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe the Tears  from her Eyes and the Sweat from her Face which I did; then she  desired she might lean her self on me saying she should faint.Justice Hathorn replied she had strength enough to torment  those persons and she should have strength enough to stand. I  speaking something against their cruel proceedings they commanded  me to be silent or else I should be turned out of the Room. The  Indian before mentioned was also brought in to be one of her  Accusers: being come in he now (when before the Justices) fell  down and tumbled about like a Hog but said nothing. The Justices  asked the Girls who afflicted the Indian? they answered she ( meaning my Wife) and now lay upon him; the Justices ordered her to touch  him in order to his cure but her head must be turned another way least instead of curing she should make him worse by her looking on him her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian took  hold on her hand and pulled her down on the Floor in a barbarous  manner; then his hand was taken off and her hand put on his and  the cure was quickly wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their  Inhumane dealings uttered a hasty Speech (That God would take vengeance on them and desired that God would deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I did with  difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room but no Beds in it;  if there had could have taken but little rest that Night. She was  committed to Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to  remove her to Cambridge Prison which is in our County of Middlesex. Having been there one Night next Morning the Jaylor put  Irons on herlegs (having received such a command) the weight of them was about eight pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions soon brought her into Convulsion Fits so that I thought she would  have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the Irons might be taken  off but all intreaties were in vain if it would have saved her Life  so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem coming on I went thither to see how things were there managed;  and finding that the Spectre-Evidence was there received together with Idle if not malicious Stories against Peoples Lives I did easily  perceive which way the rest would go; for the same Evidence that  served for one would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her with her  danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried I feared she  would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal  in our own County I with several others Petitioning the Judge for  it and were put in hopes of it; but I soon saw so much that I understood thereby it was not intended which put me upon consulting  the means of her escape; which thro the goodness of God was effected and she got to Road Island but soon found her self not safe  when there by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she  went to New York along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands; where we found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher   Esq; Governour who was very courteous to us. After this some of  my Goods were seized in a Friends hands with whom I had left them  and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff and kept in Custody half a day and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners  and their Inhumanity shewn to them at the time of their Execution  no sober Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which is the more considering what a People for Religion I mean  the profession of it we have been; those that suffered being many of  them Church-Members and most of them unspotted in their Con-  versation till their Adversary the Devil took up this Method for accusing them.

April 19 1692.Giles Cory you are brought before authority upon high suspicion of sundry acts of witchcraft; now tell us the truth in this matter.I hope through the goodness of God I shall for that matter I never had no hand in in my life. Which of you have seen this man hurt you? Mary Wolcott Mercy Lewis Ann Putnam jr. and Abigail Williams affirmed he had hurt themHath he hurt you too? speaking to Elizabeth Hubbard. She going to answer was prevented by a fit. Benjamin Gold hath he hurt you? I have seen him several times and been hurt after it but cannot affirm that it was he. Hath he brought the book to any of you? Mary Wolcott and Abigail Williams and others affirmed he had brought the book to them.Giles Cory they accuse you or your appearance of hurting them and bringing the book to them. What do you say? Why do you hurt them? Tell us the truth. I never did hurt them. It is your appearance hurts them they charge you; tell us what you have done. I have done nothing to damage them.Have you ever entered into contract with the devil? I never did. What temptations have you had? I never had temptations in my life. What have you done it without temptations?What was the reason (said goodwife Bibber) that you were frighted in the cow-house? and then the questionist was suddenly seized with a violent fit.Samuel Braybrook goodman Bibber and his daughter testified that he had told them this morning that he was frighted in the cow-house. Cory denied it. This was not your appearance but your person and you told them so this morning: why do you deny it? What did you see in the cow-house? I never saw nothing but my cattle. Divers witnessed that he told them he was frighted. Well what do you say to these witnesses? What was it frighted you? I do not know that ever I spoke the word in my life. Tell the truth what was it frighted you? I do not know any thing that frighted me.All the afflicted were seized now with fits and troubled with pinches. Then the court ordered his hands to be tied. What is it not enough to act witchcraft at other times but must you do it now in the face of authority? I am a poor creature and cannot help it. Upon the motion of his head again they had their heads and necks afflicted.Why do you tell such wicked lies against witnesses that heard you speak after this manner this very morning? I never saw any thing but a black hog. You said that you were stopt once in prayer; what stopt you? I cannot tell; my wife came towards me and found fault with me for saying living to God and dying to sin.What was it frighted you in the barn? I know nothing frighted me there. Why here are three witnesses that heard you say so to-day. I do not remember it.Thomas Gold testified that he heard him say that he knew enough against his wife that would do her business. What was it that you knew against your wife? Why that of living to God and dying to sin. The Marshal and Bibber's daughter confirmed the same that he said he could say that that would do his wife's business.I have said what I can say to that. What was that about your ox? I thought he was hipt.What ointment was that your wife had when she was seized? You said it was ointment she made by major Gidney's direction. He denied it and said she had it of goody Bibber or from her direction. Goody Bibber said it is not like that ointment. You said you knew upon your own knowledge that she had it of major Gidney. He denied it.Did not you say when you went to the ferry with your wife you would not go over to Boston now for you should come yourself the next week? I would not go over because I had not money. The Marshal testified he said as before.One of his hands was let go and several were afflicted. He held his head on one side and then the heads of seve- ral of the afflicted were held on one side. He drew in his cheeks and the cheeks of some of the afflicted were suckt in.John Bibber and his wife gave testimony concerning some temptations he had to make away with himself. How doth this agree with what you said that you had no temptations? I meant temptation to witchcraft. If you can give away to self murther that will make way to temptation to witchcraft.Note. There was witness by several that he said he would make away with himself and charge his death up- on his son. Goody Bibber testified that the said Cory called said Bibber's husband damn'd devilish rogue. Other vile expressions testified in open court by several others.                                                                       Salem Village April 19 1692.

"SWP No. 37.12(Letter from Thomas Putnam to Judge  Samuel Sewall an ""Extract"")The Last Night my Daughter Ann was grievously Tormented by Witches Threatning that she should be Pressed to Death before Giles Cory . But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God she had at last a  little Respite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that Giles Cory had Murdered him by Pressing him to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there  appeared unto him and Covenented with him and promised him He should not be Hanged. The Apparition said God Hardened his  Heart that he should not hearken to the Advice of the Court and so  Dy an easy Death; because as it said “It must be done to him as he  has done to me.” The Apparition also said That Giles Cory was  Carry'd to the Court for this and that the Jury had found the  Murder and that her Father knew the man and the thing was done before she was born. Now Sir This is not a little strange to us; that no body should Remember these things all the while that Giles Cory was in Prison and so often before the Court. For all people now Remember very well (and the Records of the Court also mention it) That about Seventeen Years ago Giles Cory kept a man  in his House that was almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him among whom was Dr. Zorobbabel Endicot ; who found the man bruised to Death and having clodders of Blood about his Heart. The Jury whereof several are yet alive brought in the man Murdered; but as if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter the Court  Proceeded not against Giles Cory  tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony to get off.( Cotton Mather Wonders of the Invisible World.

SWP No. 38.3(Examination of Martha Corey as Told by Deodat Lawson)[March 21 1692]On Monday the 21st of March The Magistrates of Salem appointed to come to Examination of Goodw C. And about twelve of the Clock they went into the Meeting-House which was Thronged with Spectators: Mr. Noyes began with a very pertinent and pathetic  Prayer; and Goodwife C. being called to answer to what was Alledged against her she desired to go to Prayer which was much wondred at in the presence of so many hundred people: The Magistrates told her they would not admit it; they came not there to hear her Pray but to Examine her in what was Alledged against her. The Worshipful Mr. Hathorne asked her Why she Afflicted those Children! she said she did not Afflict them. He asked her who did then? she said I do not know; How should I know? The Number of the Afflicted Persons were about that time Ten viz. Four Married Women Mrs Pope Mrs. Putman Goodw. Bibber and an Ancient Woman named Goodall three Maids Mary Walcut Mercy Lewes at Thomas Putman’s and a Maid at Dr. Griggs’s there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age each of them or thereabouts viz. Elizabeth Parris Abigail Williams and Ann Putman; these were most of them at G. C’s Examination and did vehemently accuse her in the Assembly of afflicting them by Biting Pinching Strangling &c. And that they did in their Fit see her Likeness coming to them and bringing a Book to them she said she had no Book; they affirmed she had a Yellow-Bird that used to suck betwixt her Fingers and being asked about it if she had any Familiar Spirit that attended her she said She had no Familiarity with any such thing- She was a Gospel Woman: which Title she called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her ah! She was A Gospel Witch. Ann Putman did there affirm that one day when Lieutenant Fuller was at Prayer at her Fathers House she saw the shape of Goodw. C. and she thought Goodw. N. Praying at the same time to the Devil she was not sure it was Goodw. N. she thought it was; but very sure she saw the Shape of G. C. The said C. said they were poor distracted Children and no heed to be given to what they said. Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes replyed it was the judgment of all that were present they were Bewitched and only she the Accused Person said they were Distracted. It was observed several times that if she did but bite her Under lip in time of Examination the persons afflicted were bitten on their armes and wrists and produced the Marks before the Magistrates Ministers and others. And being watched for that if she did but Pinch her Fingers or Graspe one Hand hard in another they were Pinched and produced the Marks before the Magistrates and Spectators. After that it was observed that if she did but lean her Breast against the Seat in the Meeting House (being the Barr at which she stood) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of grievous torment in her Bowels as if they were torn out. She vehemently accused said C. as the instrument and first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home she got off her Shoe and hit Goodwife C. on the head with it. After these postures were watched if said C. did but stir her feet they were afflicted in their Feet and stamped fearfully. The afflicted persons asked her why she did not go to the company of Witches which were before the Meeting house mustering? Did she not hear the Drum beat? They accused her of having Familiarity with the Devil in the time of Examination in the shape of a Black man whispering in her ear; they affirmed that her Yellow-Bird sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly; and order being given to see if there were any sign the Girl that saw it said it was too late now; she had removed a Pin and put it on her head; which was found there sticking upright. They told her she had Covenanted with the Devil for ten years six of them were gone and four more to come. She was required by the Magistrates to answer that Question in the Catechism How many persons be there in the God-Head? she answered it but oddly yet was there no great thing to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon her and said They could not prove a Witch; she was that Afternoon Committed to Salem-Prison; and after she was in Custody she did not so appear to them and afflict them as before.( Deodat Lawson.

SWP No. 68.10(Testimony of the Rev. John Hale v. Dorcas Hoar )[September 6 1692 ]John Hale aged 56 yeares Testifieth 6. 7. 1692 That for severall yeares agoe formerly were storys told concerning Dorcas Hoar her beeing a fortune teller. And that she had told her owne fortune viz that she should live poorely so long as her husband willm Hoar did live but the said will should dye before her & after that shee should live better. Allso the fortune of Ens: Corning & his wife who should dye.first & that shee had had a book of fortune telling. About twenty two yeares agoe the s'd Dorcas manifested to me great repentance for the sins of her former life & that she had borrowed a book of Palmstry & their were rules to know what should come to pass. But I telling her that it was an evill book & evill art shee seemed to me to renounce or reject all such practices: whereupon I had great charity for her severall yeares. But 14 yeares agoe last spring I discovered  an evillractice had been between a servant of mine & some of s'd Hoars children in conveying goods out of my house to the s'd Hoars . and I had a daughter Rebecca then between 11 & 12 years old whome I asked if she knew of the Hoars stealing: she told me yea But durst not reveale it to me & one reason was she was threatened that Goody Hoar was a witch & had a book by w'ch shee could tell what s'd Rebecca did tell me in my house & if the s'd Rebecca told me of the stealing the said Hoar would raise the devill to kill her or bewitch her or words to that effect. (but whether she said that Dorcas her selfe or her chilldren told Rebecca those words I remember not) I asked Rebecca if she saw the book she said yea she was shewed that book & their were many streaks & pictures in it by w'ch (as she was told) the said Hoar could reveale secretes & work witchcrafts. I asked her how big the book was she said it was like a gramer that lay on the table. And said shee now I have told you of the stealing Goody Hoar will bewitch me. I perswaded my daughter not to think so hardly of Goody Hoar . But she replyed I know Goody Hoar is a witch (or to the effect) & then told storys of strange things that had been acted in or about my house when I & my wife were abroad to fright s'd Rebecca into silence about the theft w'ch s'd Rebecca judged to be acts of s'd Hoars witchcraft the particulars I have now forgotten. I called to minde that the s'd Hoar had told me of a book of palmstry she had but not the bigness of it; therefore that I might be better satisfyed I asked Thomas Tuck if he knew Goody Hoar to have a book of fortune telling & he said yea shee had such a kind of book w'ch he had seen w'th streaks & pictures in it and that it was about the bigness of such a book poynting to a gramer or book of like magnitude. this confirmed me in the opinion that my daughter had seen such a book. And after my daughters death a freind told me that my daughter said to her shee went in fear of her life by the hoars till quieted by the script'r. Fear not them w'ch can kill the boady &c.About those times other things were spoken of the s'd Hoares suspicians of her witchcraft whereupon a frend of mine did as I was informed acquaint Maj'r Denison w'th them for his consideration & as I was informed Maj'r Denison took an opportunity to examine s'd W'm Hoare about a fortune book his wife had & W'm Hoar answered the book was John Samsons & his wife had returned the  book long agoe & so the matter was left for that time. When discourses revived of Goody Hoars fortune telling of later times & she beeing comited to Boston I did last may speak w'th her of may things that I had known & heard of her. Shee told me that he owne fortune that she spake of she was told by a shipmaster when she was first marryed. & Ens: Corning fortune viz that his first wife should dye before him (w'ch is since come to pass) she sapke it from observing a certain streak under the eye of s'd Corning or his wife: But as I take it it was his wife had the streak. And for seeing the devill or any spirit but ones & that was soon after old Thomas Tuck dyed (w'ch I take to be about ten yeare since) & that shee took it to be the Ghost of Thom: tuck coming to speak w'th her about some land s'd Tuck had told her of before his death. But that shee fled from the Ghost & got away.The fortune book she said was about the bigness of a childs Psalter (w'ch agrees w'th that of a gramer) But owned no other but that of John Samsons w'ch he had from her as she said above 20 years agoe & that shee had not told fortunes since the time I had layed before her the evill of it. w'ch is about 20 or 22 years since. I lately spake w'th John Samson & he told me that he had a book of Palmstry when he lived at Goody Hoars w'ch shee had seen: but that it was a book in quarto. & he sold it at Casco-Bay about 30 yeares since & had not seen it since                                                          Jurat in Curia(Reverse)  Mr. Jno.

The reason of my Confinement is this I having through the Magistrates Threatnings and my own Vile and Wretched Heart confessed several things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg tho to the Wounding of my own Soul the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded Conscience who can bear. But blessed be the Lord he would not let me go on in my Sins but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in any longer but I was forced to confess the truth of all before the Magistrates who would not believe me but tis their pleasure to put me in here and God knows how soon I shall be put to death.

SWP No. 80.4( Petition of Margaret Jacobs )[+ January 4 1693]The humble declaration of Margaret Jacobs unto the honoured court now sitting at Salem shewethThat whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely confined here in Salem goal for the crime of witchcraft which crime thanks be to the Lord I am altogether ignorant of as will appear at the great day of judgment: May it please the honoured court I was cried out upon by some of the possessed persons as afflicting them; whereupon I was brought to my examination which persons at the sight of me fell down which did very much startle and affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing in the least measure how or who afflicted them; they told me without doubt I did or else they would not fall down at me; they told me if I would not confess I should be put down into the dungeon and would be hanged but if I would confess I should have my life; the which did so affright me with my own vile wicked heart to save my life; made me make the like confession I did which confession may it please the honoured court is altogether false and untrue. The very first night after I had made confession I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep for fear the devil should carry me away for telling such horrid lies. I was may it please the honoured court sworn to my confession as I understand since but then at that time was ignorant of it not knowing what an oath did mean. The Lord I hope in whom I trust out of the abundance of his mercy will forgive me my false forswearing myself. What I said was altogether false against my grandfather and Mr. Burroughs  which I did to save my life and to have my liberty; but the Lord charging it to my conscience made me in so much horror that I could not contain myself before I had denied my confession which I did though I saw nothing but death before  me chusing rather death with a quiet conscience than to live in such horror which I could not suffer. Where upon my denying my confession I was committed to close prison where I have enjoyed more felicity in spirit a thousand times than I did before in my enlargement.And now may it please your honours your declarant having in part given your honours a description of my condition do leave it to your honours pious and judicious discretions to take pity and compassion on my young and tender years to act and do with me as the Lord above and your honours shall see good having no friend but the Lord to plead my cause for me; not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft nor any other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble declarant shall for ever pray as she is bound in duty for your honours happiness in this life and eternal felicity in the world to come.

Higginson.Goody Foster you remember we have three times spoken with you and do you now remember what you then confessed to us? Her former confession was read which she owned to be all true.You have been engaged in very great wickedness and some have been left to hardness of heart to deny; but it seems that God will give you more favor than others inasmuch as you relent. But your daughter here hath confessed some things that you did not tell us of. Your daughter was with you and Goody Carrier when you did ride upon the stick. A. I did not know it. Q. How long have you known your daughter to be engaged? A. I cannot tell nor have I any knowledge of it at all. Q. Did you see your daughter at the meeting? A. No. Q. Did not you know your daughter to be a witch? A. No. Q. Your daughter said she was at the witches meeting and that you yourself stood at a distance off and did not partake at that meeting; and you yourself said so also; give us a relation from the beginning until now. A. I know none of their names that were there but only Goody Carrier. Q. Would you know their frees if you saw them? A. I (400) cannot tell. Q. Were there not two companies in the field at the same time? A. I remember no more.    Mary Warren one of the afflicted said that Goody Carrier’s shape told her that this Goody Foster had made her daughter a witch. Q. Do not you acknowledge that you did so about thirteen years ago? A.

Q. In what shape? A. In the shape of a horse. Q. What did he say to you? A. He bid me not to be afraid of any tiring and he would not bring me out; but he has proved a liar from the beginning. Q. When was this? A. I know not; above a week. Q. Did you set your hand to the book? A. No. Q. Did he bid you worship him? A. Yes; he bid me also afflict persons. You are now in the way to obtain mercy if you will confess and repent. She said The Lord help me. Q. Do not you desire to be saved by Christ? A. Yes.

And then said Martin was biting her lips.Have not you compassion on these afflicted -- No I have none They cryed out there was the black man along with her & Goody Bibber confirmed itAbig: Williams went towards her but could not come near her. norGoody Bibber tho she had not accused her before: also Mary Walcot could not come near her. John Indian said he would kill her if he came near her but he fell down before he could touch herWhat is the reason these cannot come near you? I cannot tell it may be the Devil bears me more malice than an other. Do you not see God evidently discovering you? No not a bit for that. All the congregation besides think so. Let them think what they will. What is the reason these cannot come to you? I do not know but they can if they will or else if you please I will come to them.

I can say before my Eternal father I am innocent & God will clear my innocency Here is never a one in the Assembly but desires it but if you be guilty Pray God discover you. Then Hen: Kenny rose up to speakGoodm: Kenny what do you sayThen he entered his complaint & farther said that since this Nurse came into the house he was seizd twise with an amaz'd conditionHere are not only these but here is the wife of Mr Tho: Putman who accuseth you by credible information & that both of tempting her to iniquity & of greatly hurting her.N. I am innocent & clear & have not been able to get out of doors these 8. or 9. dayes. Mr Putman: give in what you have to sayThen Mr Edward Putman gave in his relateIs this true Goody NurseI never afflicted no child never in my life You see these accuse you is it true No. Are you an innocent person relating to this Witchcraft. Here Tho: Putmans wife cryed out Did you not bring the Black man with you did you not bid me tempt God & dye How oft have you eat and drunk y'r own damaon What do you say to themOh Lord help me & spread out her hands & the afflicted were greviously vexed Do you not see what a solemn condition theseare in? when your hands are loose the pesons are afflicted. Then Mary Walcot (who often heretofore said she had seen her but never could say or did say that she either bit or pincht her or hurt her) & also Eliz: Hubbardunder the like circumstances both openly accused her of hurting themHere are these 2 grown persons now accuse you w't say you? Do not you see these afflicted persons & hear them accuse you. The Lord knows I have not hurt them: I am an inno-cent person It is very awfull to all to see these agonies & you an old Professor thus charged with contracting with the Devil by the effects of it & yet to see you stand with dry eyes when there are so many whet -- You do not know my heart You would do well if you are guilty to confess & give Glory to God I am as clear as the child unborn What uncertainty there may be in apparitions I know not yet this with me strikes hard upon you that you are at this very present charged with fa-miliar spirits: this is your bodily person they speak to: they say now they see these familiar spirits com to your bodily #[spirits com to your bodily] person now what do you say to that I have none Sir: If you have confess & give glory to God I pray God clear you if you be innocent & if you are guilty discover you And therefore give me an upright answer: have you any familiarity with these spirits? No I have none but with God alone. How came you sick for there is an odd discourse of that in the mouths of many -- I am sick at my stumach -- Have you no wounds I have none but old age You do Know whither you are guilty & have familiarity with the Devil & now when you are here present tosee such a thing as these testify a black man whis-pering in your ear & birds about you what do you say to it It is all false I am clear Possibly you may apprehend you are no witch but have you not been led aside by temptations that way I have not What a sad thing it is that a church member here & now an other of Salem should be thus accused and charged Mrs Pope fell into a grevious fit & cryed out a sad thing sure enough: And then many more fell into lamentable fits.Tell us have not you had visible appearances more than what is common in nature? I have noe nor never had in my life Do you think these suffer voluntary or involuntary I cannot tell That is strange every one can judge I must be silent They accuse you of hurting them & if you think it is not unwillingly but by designe you must look upon them as murderers I cannot tell what to think of it Afterwards when this was som what insisted on she said I do not think so: she did not under-stand aright what was said Well then give an answer now do you think these suffer against their wills or not I do not think these suffer against their wills Why did you never visit these afflicted persons Because I was afraid I should have fits too Note Upon the motion of her body #[had] fitts followed upon the complainants abundantly & very frequently Is it not an unaccountable case that when #[they]you  are examined these persons are afflicted? I have got no body to look to but God Again upon stirring her hands the afflicted persons were seized with violent fits of torture Do you beleive these afflicted persons are bewitchtI do think they are When this Witchcraft came upon the stage there was no suspicion of Tituba ( Mr Paris's Indian woman) she profest much love to that child Betty Paris  but it was her apparition did the mischief & why should not you also be guilty for your apparition doth hurt also.Would you have me bely my #[your] self -- she held her Neck on one side & accordingly so were the afflicted taken Then Authority requiring it Sam: Paris read what he had in characters taken from Mr Tho: Putmanswife in her fittsWhat do you think of this I cannot help it the Devil may appear in my shap.

SWP No. 94.3(Examination of Rebecca Nurse as Told byDeodat Lawson)[March 24 1692]On Thursday the Twenty fourth of march (being in course the Lecture Day at the Village) Goodwife N. was brought before the Magistrates Mr Hathorne and Mr Corwin about Ten of Clock in the Fore Noon to be Examined in the Meeting House; the Reverend Mr. Hale begun with Prayer and the Warrant being read she was required to give answer Why she aflicted those persons? she pleaded her owne innocency with earnestness. Thomas Putman’s Wife Abigail Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she appeared to them and afflicted them in their fitts: but some of the other said that they had seen her but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which was Mary Walcut who was presently after she had so declared bitten and cryed out of her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her wrist. It was so disposed that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of Examination but both Magistrates and Ministers told me that the things alledged by the afflicted and defences made by her were much after the same manner as the former was. And her motions did produce like effects as to Biteing Pinching Bruising Tormenting at their Breasts by her Leaning and when bended Back were as if their Backs was broken. The afflicted persons said the Black Man whispered to her in the Assembly and therefore she could not hear what the Magistrates said unto her. They said also that she did then ride by the Meeting-house behind the Black Man. Thomas Putman’s wife had a grievous Fit in the time of Examination to the very great Impairing of her strength and wasting of her spirits insomuch as she could hardly move hand or foot when she was carryed out. Others also were there grievously afflicted so that there was once such an hideous scrietch and noise (which I heard as I walked at a little distance from the Meeting house) as did amaze me and some that were within told me the whole assembly was struck with consternation and they were afraid that those that sate next to them were under the influence of Witchcraft. This woman also was that day committed to Salem Prison.( Deodat Lawson.

SWP No. 96.1(Examination of Mary Osgood )[September 8 1692]The examination and confession (8. Sept. 92.)  of Mary Osgood  wife of Captain Osgood of Andover taken before John Hawthorne and other their Majesties justices.She confesses that about 11 years ago when she was in a melancholy state and condition she used to walk abroad in her orchard; and upon a certain time she saw the appearance of a cat at the end of the house which yet she thought was a real cat. However at that time it diverted her from praying to God and instead thereof she prayed to the devil; about which time she made a covenant with the devil who as a black man came to her and presented her a book upon which she laid her finger and that left a red spot: And that upon her signing the devil told her he was her God and that she should serve and worship him and she believes she consented to it. She says further that about two years agone she was carried through the air in company with deacon Frye's wife  Ebenezer Baker's wife  and Goody Tyler  to five mile pond where she was baptized by the devil who dipped her face in the water and made her renounce her former baptism and told her she must be his soul and body forever and that she must serve him which she promised to do. She says the renouncing her first baptism was after her dipping and that she was transported back again through the air in company with the forenamed persons in the same manner as she went and believes they were carried upon a pole. Q. How many persons were upon the pole? A. As I said before viz. four persons and no more but whom she had named above. -- She confesses she has afflicted three persons John Sawdy  Martha Sprague and Rose Foster  and that she did it by pinching her bed clothes and giving consent the devil should do it in her shape and that the devil could not do it without her consent. -- She confesses the afflicting persons in the court by the glance of her eye. She says as she was coming down to Salem to be  examined she and the rest of the company with her stopped at Mr. Phillips's to refresh themselves and the afflicted persons being behind them upon the road came up just as she was mounting again and were then afflicted and cried out upon her so that she was forced to stay until they were all past and said she only looked that way towards them. Q. Do you know the devil can take the shape of an innocent person and afflict? A. I believe he cannot. Q. Who taught you this way of witchcraft? A. Satan and that he promised her abundance of satisfaction and quietness in her future state but never performed any thing; and that she has lived more miserably and more discontented since than ever before. She confesses further that she herself in company with Goody Parker  Goody Tyler  and Goody Dean  had a meeting at Moses Tyler's house last monday night to afflict and that she and Goody Dean carried the shape of Mr. Dean the minister between them to make persons believe that Mr. Dean afflicted. Q. What hindered you from accomplishing what you intended? A. The Lord would not suffer it so to be that the devil should afflict in an innocent person's shape. Q. Have you been at any other witch meetings? A. I know nothing thereof as I shall answer in the presence of God and his people; but said that the black man stood before her and told her that what she had confessed was a lie; notwithstanding she said that what she had confessed was true and thereto put her hand. Her husband being present was asked if he judged his wife to be any way discomposed. He answered that having lived with her so long he doth not judge her to be any ways discomposed but has cause to believe what she has said is true. -- When Mistress Osgood was first called she afflicted Martha Sprague and Rose Foster  by the glance of her eyes and recovered them out of their fits by the touch of her hand. Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson and Hannah Post saw Mistress Osgood afflicting Sprague and Foster . -- The said Hannah Post and Mary Lacey and Betty Johnson jun. and Rose Foster and Mary Richardson were afflicted by Mistress Osgood  in the time of their examination and recovered by her touching of their hands.I underwritten being appointed by authority to take this examination do testify upon oath taken in court that this is a true copy of the substance of it to the best of my knowledge  5 Jan1692 -- 3. The within Mary Osgood was examined before their Majesties justices of the peace in Salem.Attest. John Higginson  Just.

SWP No. 96.2( Recantation of Mary Osgood as Reported by Rev. Increase Mather)[October 19 1692]Mrs. Osgood freely and relentingly said that the confession which she made upon her examination for witchcraft and afterwards acknowledged before the honourable judges was wholly false and that she was brought to the said confession by the violent urging and unreasonable pressings that were used toward her; she asserted that she never signed to the devill’s book was never baptised by the devill never afflicted any of the accusers or gave her consent for their being afflicted. Being asked why she prefixed a time and spake of her being baptised &c.: about twelve years since; she replyed and said that when she had owned the thing they asked the time; to which she answered that she knew not the time; but being told that she did know the time and must tell the time and the like; she considered that about twelve years before (when she had her last child) she had a fitt of sicknesse and was melancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any and accordingly did prefix the said time.Being asked about the cat in the shape of which she had confessed the devill appeared to her &c. she replyed that being told that the devill had appeared to her and must needs appear to her &c.; (she being a witch) she at length did own that the devill had appeared to her; and being press’d to say in what creature’s shape he appeared in she at length did say that it was in the shape of a cat; remembering that some time before her being apprehended as she went out at her door she saw a cat &c.: not as though she any whitt suspected the said cat to be the devill in the day of *** but because some creature she must mention and this came thus into her mind at that time.( Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society Boston MA. 2nd ser. vol. 3 (Boston: John Eliot 1815) pp. 222. ),1692,October,96.2
SWP No. 96.3(Petition for Mary Osgood  Eunice Fry  Deliverance Dane  Sarah Wilson Sr.  and Abigail Barker )[++ January 3 1693]To the honoured court of Assize held at Salem The humble address of several of the inhabitants of Andover. May it please this honoured court We being very sensible of the great sufferings our neighbours have been long under in prison and charitably judging that many of them are clear of that great transgression which hath been laid to their charge have thought it our duty to endeavour their vindication so far as our testimony for them will avail. The persons in whose behalf we are desired and concerned to speak something at present are Mrs. Mary Osgood  Eunice Frye  Deliverance Dane  Sarah Wilson and Abigail Barker  who are women of whom we can truly give this character and commendation that they have not only lived among us so inoffensively as not to give the least occasion to any that know them to suspect them of witchcraft but by their sober godly and exemplary conversation have obtained a good report in the place where they have been well esteemed and approved in the church of which they are members.We were surprized to hear that persons of known integrity and piety were accused of so horrid a crime not considering then that the most innocent were liable to be so misrepresented and abused. When these women were accused by some afflicted persons of the neighbourhood their relations and others tho' they had so good grounds of charity that they should not have thought any evil of them yet through a misrepresentation of the truth of that evidence that was so much credited and improved against people took great pains to persuade them to own what they were by the afflicted charged with and indeed did unreasonably urge them to confess themselves guilty as some of us who were then present can testify. But these good women did very much assert their innocency yet some of them said they were not without fear least Satan had some way ensnared them because there was that evidence against them which then was by many thought to be a certain indication and discovery of witchcraft yet they seriously professed they knew nothing by themselves of that nature: Nevertheless by the unwearied sollicitations of those that privately discoursed them both  at home and at Salem they were at length persuaded publickly to own what they were charged with and so submit to that guilt which we still hope and believe they are clear of. And it is probable the fear of what the event might be and the encouragement that it is said was suggested to them that confessing was the only way to obtain favour might be too powerful a temptation for timorous women to withstand in the hurry and distraction that we have heard they were then in. Had what they said against themselves proceeded from conviction of the fact we should have had nothing to have said for them but we are induced to think that it did not because they did soon privately retract what they had said as we are informed and while they were in prison they declared to such as they had confidence to speak freely and plainly to that they were not guilty of what they had owned and that what they had said against themselves was the greatest grief and burden they laboured under: Now though we cannot but judge it a thing very sinful for innocent persons to own a crime they are not guilty of yet considering the well ordered conversation of those women while they lived among us and what they now seriously and constantly affirm in a more composed frame we cannot but in charity judge them innocent of the great transgression that hath been imputed to them. As for the rest of our neighbours who are under the like circumstances with these that have been named we can truly say of them that while they lived among us we have had no cause to judge them such persons as of late they have been represented and reported to be nor do we know that any of their neighbours had any just grounds to suspect them of that evil that they are now charged with.Dudley BradstreetFrancis Dane sen.Thomas BarnardTho.

SWP No. 98.6(Petition of John Parker & Joseph Parker for Restitution for Mary Parker)[November 7 1692 ] To his Excellency the Governor and Councill and Representatives; now sitting  in Boston the humble Petition of John Parker & Joseph Parker of Andover shewethThat whereas our mother mary Parker of Andover was apprehended upon suspition of witchcraft and being brought to a tryall at Salem Court was condemned: since her death the sherriff of Essex sent an officer to seise on her estate. The said officer required us in their majestyes name to give him an Account of our mothers estate pretending it was forfeited to the King; we told him that our mother left no estate; (which we are able to make appear) notwithstanding which he seised upon our cattell Corn & hay to a considerable value; and ordered us to go down to Salem and make an agreement with the sherrife otherwise the estate would be exposed to sale. We not knowing what advantage the Law might give him against us and fearing we should sustain greater Damage by the loss of our Estate went to the sherriff accordingly who told us he might take away all that was seised. if he pleased but was willing to do us a kindness by giveing us an oppertunity to redeem it. He at first demanded ten pounds of us but at length was willing to take Six pounds which he has  obliged us by Bill to pay him within a moneth. Now if our Mother had left any Estate we know not of any Law in force in this Province by which it should be forfeited upon her condemnation; much less can we understand that there is any Justice or reason for the sherriff to seise upon our Estate And tho it is true our own act has obliged us to pay him a Summ of money yet we declare that we were drawn to it partly by the officers great pretences of Law for what he did partly to prevent the loss of our estate which we feard would be immediately sold.Now we humbly pray this Hon'red Court to consider our case and if it be judged that so much money ought not to have been demanded of us upon the forementioned account: we pray that we may be discharged from that obligation which the sherriff taking advantage of our ignorance hath brough us under And yo'r Petition'rs as in duty bound shall ever pray &c -- Dated at Andov'r  7'th Novemb'r 1692  John Parker Joseph Parker ( Mass.

Mr. Mather Mr. Allen  Mr. Moody  Mr. Willard and Mr. Bailey.Reverend Gentlemen.The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our Judges and Jury whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn having Condemned us already before our Tryals being so much incensed and engaged against us by the Devil makes us bold to Beg and Implore your Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency That if it be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared which undoubtedly otherwise will be shed if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates Ministers Jewries and all the People in general being so much inraged and incensed against us by the Delusion of the Devil which we can term no other by reason we know in our own Consciences we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five Persons who have lately confessed themselves to be Witches and do accuse some of us of being along with them at a Sacrament since we were committed into close Prison which we know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons) Youngmen who would not confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels till the Blood was ready to come out of their Noses and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the occasion of making them confess that they never did by reason they said one had been a  Witch a Month and another five Weeks and that their Mother had made them so who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William Procter  when he was examin'd because he would not confess that he was Guilty when he was Innocent they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out at his Nose and would have kept him so 24 Hours if one more Merciful than the rest had not taken pity on him and caused him to be unbound. These actions are very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates and that will not serve their turns without our Innocent Bloods.

In some of the fitts that I had afterwards I was sensless and knew not that I saw who it was that afflicted me. In one fitt (upon the beginning it) I thought I saw goodw Jackson and widow Scott come waking into the chamber with y'r staves one of them came & sat upon me so that I could not stirr; Goodw Jackson I saw no more no know I that she did me any harm. In another fitt I saw the appearance of s'd Scott in the room who afflicted me and being speechless I continued so untill I went to the s'd Scott who taking me by the hand I had the liberty of speech again as formerly. The last fitt I had was upon the last Sabb'th day in which I saw the shapes of four women or five of whom widow Scott was one the rest I knew not nor knew that any did hurt me unless s'd widow Scott.

Mary Warren affirmed that she never saw the s'd woman before only in apparition and then she told her that her Name was Abigail Soams and that she was sister to John Soams of Preston Cooper and that she Lived att Gaskins and that she had lain Bedrid a year. Being asked whether she was sister to John Soams she answered peremptorily she would not tell for all was false that Warren said. furthermore Warren affirmed that she told her that she viz the s'd Soams was the Instrumental Means of the death of Southwick Upon which s'd Soams casting her Eye on Warren struck her into a dreadful fitt and bitt her so dreadfully that the Like was never seen on any of the aflicted which the s'd Warren Charged the s'd Soams with doeing off saying that the s'd    Soams told her this day she would be the death of her. further Warren Affirms  that she the s'd Soams ran two pinns into her side this day which being plucked out the blood ran out after them. Goody Gaskin being present att this Examination affirmed she had kept her Bed for most parts these thirteen months--Warren further affirms she told her that when she did goe abroad att any time it was in the Night which Goody Gaskin being present Confirmed the same that that was the Usual time off her goeing abroad -- furthermore Warren affirmed that this Abigail Soams would have had her to have made a bargain with her telling her if she would not tel of her being a sickly woman she would not afflict her any more and that then she should goe along with her for the s'd Soams told her she was her God Upon w'ch Warren answered she would not keep the Devils Councel. Soams told her she was not a Devil but she was her God. After this appearing three times more to her she s'd att one of those times she was as good as a God. Q. Mary Warren is this true? A. It is nothing but the truth. Soams being asked who hurt Warren in the time of her fits she Answered it was the Enemy hurt her. I have been said she myself distracted many a time and my senses have gone from mee and I thought I have seen many a Body hurt mee and might have accused many as well as she doth. I Really thought I had seen many persons att my Mothers house at Glocester and they greatly aflicted me as I thought: Soams being Commanded while Warren was in a dreadful fit to take Warren by the hand the said Warren immediately recovered;  this Experiment was tried three times over and the Issue the same. Warren after a Recovery being commanded to touch the s'd Soams although she assayed several times to do it with great Earnestness she was not able But fell down into a dreadful fit Upon which the s'd Soams being Commanded take Warren by the hand she immediately recovered her again Warren affirming she felt something soft in her hand (her Eyes then being first shut) which revived her very heart. Warren being asked what the Reason was she could not Come to touch Soams affirmed she saw the apparition of Soams come from her Body and would meet her and thrust her with Violence back again not suffring her to Come near her -- sometimes Soams would say it was distraction in talking she would often Laugh upon which Laughing the aflicted person would presently fal into a fit. Soams being asked whether she thought this was witchcraft or whether there were any Witches in the world answered she did not know any thing but said itt was the Enemy or some Other wicked person or the Enemy himself that forces persons to afflict her att this time presently this Warren fell into a trance comeing out of which she affirmed that Soams told her in the time of her trance that she would thrust an Awl into her very heart and would kil her this night. Soams could never cast her Eye upon Warren but immediately she struck her down and one time she affirmed s'd Soams struck her such a Blow as almost killed which made the s'd Warren break out into abundance of tears. Soams being Charged with it instead of bewailing itt Broke forth into Laughter. Warren being also afflicted by the wringing of her mouth after a strange and prodigious manner Soams being Command'd to look upon her in that fit peremptorily answered she would not same being by being ordered to turn her face about to look on the afflicted which being accordingly done she shut her Eyes Close and would not look on her being then ordered to touch her she did and immediately Warren Recovered which no sooner done but Soams opened her Eyes and looked on the afflicted and struck her into another most dreadful and terrible fit and in this manner she practised her Witchcrafts severall times before the Court. Mary Warren Looking on her affirmed this to be the very woman that had so often afflicted her dureing the Examination and Charged her with it to her face. sometimes dureing the Examination Soams would put her oun foot behind her Other leg and immediately Warrens Legs would be twisted [Reverse] that it was impossible for the strongest man there to Untwist them without Breaking her Leggs  as was seen by many present--After this Examination Warren says the apparition of Proctor Nurse and Burroughs that appeared before her and Burroughs bitt her which bite was seen by many. Also Burroughs att the same time appeared to Margaret Jacobs who was then present and told her as Jacobs affirmed that her Grandfather would be hanged Upon which the s'd Jacobs wept. it was also Observed by the Rev'd M'r Noyse that after the needle was taken away from Soams that Warren was neither bit not pinched by the s'd Soams but struck so dreadfully on her breast that she cryed out she was almost killed.

SWP No. 131.1( Rev. Increase Mather's Report of his Conversation in Prison with Martha Tyler )Goodwife Tyler did say that when she was first apprehended she had no fears upon her and did think that nothing could have made her confesse against herself; but since she had found to her great grief that she had wronged the truth and falsely accused herself: she said that when she was brought to Salem her brother Bridges rode with her and that all along the way from Andover to Salem her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch since the afflicted accused her and at her touch were raised out of their fitts and urging her to confess herself a witch; She as constantly told him that she was no witch that she knew nothing of witchcraft and begg'd him not to urge her to confesse; however when she came to Salem she was carried to a room where her brother on one side and Mr. John Emerson on the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch and that she saw the devill before her eyes at that time (and accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat him away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confess that she wished herself in any dungeon rather than be so treated. Mr. Emerson told her once and again `Well I see you will not confesse! Well I will now leave you and then you are undone body and soul forever.' Her brother urged her to confesse and told her that in so doing she could not lye: to which she answered `Good brother do not say so for I shall lye if I confess and then who shall answer unto God for my lye?' He still asserted it and said that God would not suffer so many good men to be in such an errour about it and that she would be hang'd if she did not confesse and continued so long and so violently to urge and press her to confesse that she thought verily her life would have gone from her and became so terrifyed in her mind that she  own'd at length almost any thing that they propounded to her; but she had wronged her conscience in so doing she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself and desired to mourn for it so long as she lived: This she said and a great deal more of the like nature. and all with such affection sorrow relenting grief and mourning as that it exceeds any pen to describe and express the same.(Charles W.

She said allso that a son in law of said Wiles did come & visit her (shee called him an honest young man named John as I take it) & did pitty her the said Reddington signifying to her that he beleived his mother wiles was a witch & told her storys of his mother. I allso understood by them that this Goody Wiles was mother in law to a youth named as I take it Jonathan Wiles who about twenty yeares agoe or more did act or was acted very strangly Insomuch that I was invited to joyn with Mr Cobbet  & others at Ipswich to advize & pray for the said Youth; whome some thought to counterfeit others to be possessed by the devill.

SWP No. 139.1( Rev. Increase Mather's Report of the Recantations of Mary Osgood Deliverance Dane Abigail Barker Mary Tyler Sarah Wilson Sr. Mary Bridges Sr. Mary Marston Sarah Churchill Hannah Post & Mary Post )[October 19 1692]Mrs. Osgood freely and relentingly said that the confession which she made upon her examination for witchcraft and afterwards acknowledged before the honourable judges waswholly false and that she was brought to the said confession by the violent urging andunreasonable pressings that were used toward her; she asserted that she never signed to thedevill’s book was never baptised by the devill never afflicted any of the accusers or gave herconsent for their being afflicted. Being asked why she prefixed a time and spake of her beingbaptised &c.: about twelve years since; she replyed and said that when she had owned thething they asked the time; to which she answered that she knew not the time; but beingtold that she did know the time and must tell the time and the like; she considered thatabout twelve years before (when she had her last child) she had a fitt of sicknesse and wasmelancholy; and so thought that that time might be as proper a time to mention as any andaccordingly did prefix the said time.Being asked about the cat in the shape of which she had confessed the devill appeared toher &c.; she replyed that being told that the devill had appeared to her and must needsappear to her &c.; (she being a witch) she at length did own that the devill had appeared toher; and being press’d to say in what creature’s shape he appeared in she at length did saythat it was in the shape of a cat; remembering that some time before her being apprehendedas she went out at her door she saw a cat &c.: not as though she any whitt suspected thesaid cat to be the devill in the day of *** but because some creature she must mention andthis came thus into her mind at that time.Deacon Fry’s wife said that the confession she made she was frighted into and that itwas all of it false.Mrs. Dean and Goodwife Barker said freely that they had wronged the truth in makingtheir confession; that they in their lives time never covenanted with the devill or had seenhim; that they were press’d and urg’d and affrighted; that at last they did say even any thingthat was desired of them; they said that they were sensible of their great evill in giving way atlast to own what was false and spake all with such weeping relenting and bleeding as wasenough to affect the hardest heart; particularly G. Barker bewail’d and lamented her accusingof others whom she never knew any evill by in her life time; and said that she was told by herexaminers that she did know of their being witches and must confesse it; that she did know oftheir being baptised &c.: and must confesse it; by the renewed urgings and chargings of whom at last she gave way and owned such things as were utterly false which now she wasin great horrour and anguish of soul for her complying with.Goodwife Tyler did say that when she was first apprehended she had no fears upon herand did think that nothing could have made her confesse against herself; but since she hadfound to her great grief that she had wronged the truth and falsely accused herself: she saidthat when she was brought to Salem her brother Bridges rode with her and that all alongthe way from Andover to Salem her brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witchsince the afflicted accused her and at her touch were raised out of their fitts and urging herto confess herself a witch; she as constantly told him that she was no witch that she knewnothing of witchcraft and begg’d of him not to urge her to confesse; however when she cameto Salem she was carried to a room where her brother on one side and Mr. John Emersonon the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch and that she saw the devill beforeher eyes at that time (and accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beathim away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confesse that she wished herself in anydungeon rather than be so treated: Mr. Emerson told her once and again Well! I see youwill not confesse! Well! I will now leave you and then you are undone body and soulforever: Her brother urged her to confesse and told her that in so doing she could not lye; towhich she answered Good brother do not say so for I shall lye if I confesse and then whoshall answer unto God for my lye? He still asserted it and said that God would not suffer somany good men to be in such an errour about it and that she would be hang’d if she did notconfesse and continued so long and so violently to urge and presse her to confesse that shethought verily her life would have gone from her and became so terrifyed in her mind thatshe own’d at length almost any thing that they propounded to her; but she had wronged herconscience in so doing she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself and desired tomourn for it as long as she lived: This she said and a great deal more of the like nature andall of it with such affection sorrow relenting grief and mourning as that it exceeds any penfor to describe and expresse the same.Goodwife Wilson said that she was in the dark as to some things in her confession; yetshe asserted that knowingly she never had familiarity with the devill; that knowingly shenever consented to the afflicting of any person &c. However she said that truly she was inthe dark as to the matter of her being a witch; and being ask’d how she was in the dark shereplyed that the afflicted persons crying out of her as afflicting them made her fearfull ofherself and that was all that made her say that she was in the dark.Goodwife Bridges said that she had confessed against herself things which were allutterly false and that she was brought to her confession by being told that she certainly was awitch and so made to believe it though she had no other grounds so to believe.Goodwife Marston said that she had a burthen upon her conscience and that she hadbeen burthened ever since she had made her confession for she had wronged the truth andbelyed herself; she never was guilty of witchcraft or having to do with the devill (as she knewof) in her life time.Sarah Churchill knew not whether it was in the day time or night time that she stuckthe thorns in the three poppets.Hannah Post said that Margaret Jacobs was choking of S.

SWP No. 163.1(Letter of William Phips to the Privy Council)[October 12 1692]When I first arrived I found this Province miserably harrassed with a most Horrible witchcraft or Possession of Devills which had broke in upon severall Townes some scores of poor people were taken with preternaturall torments some scalded with brimstone some had pins stuck in their flesh others hurried into the fire and water and some dragged out of their houses and carried over the tops of trees and hills for many Miles together; it hath been represented to mee much like that of Sweden about thirty years agoe and there were many committed to prison upon suspicion of Witchcraft before my arrivall. The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted people with the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others prevailed with mee to give a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering what witchcraft might be at the bottome or whether it were not a possession. The chief Judge in this Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest were persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon. When the Court came to sitt at Salem in the County of Essex they convicted more than twenty persons of being guilty of witchcraft some of the convicted were such as confessed their Guilt the Court as I understand began their proceedings with the accusations of the afflicted and then went upon other humane evidences to strengthen that. I was almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their Majesties in the Eastern part of the County and depended upon the Judgment of the Court as to a right method of proceeding in cases of Witchcraft but when I came home I found many persons in a strange ferment of dissatisfaction which was increased by some hott Spiritts that blew up the flame but on enquiring into the matter I found that the  Devill had taken upon him the name and shape of severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain knowledge of good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the committing of any more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity and those that have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings against them wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be done unto the Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions or commands if their Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller ordering this perplexed affair. I have also put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or other that may increase the needless disputes of people upon this occasion because I saw a likelyhood of kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admitt any publique and open Contests and I have grieved to see that some who should have done their Majesties and this Province better service have so far taken Councill of Passion as to desire the precipitancy of these matters these things have been improved by some to give me many interuptions in their Majesties service and in truth none of my vexations have been greater than this than that their majesties service has been hereby unhappily clogged and the Persons who have made soe ill improvement of these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon mee but I hereby declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their Majesties Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might be exposed to if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did prevaile either to the committing or trying any of them I did before any application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings of the Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be known. Sir I beg pardon for giving you all this trouble the reason is because I know my enemies are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take this liberty because I depend upon your friendship and desire you will please to give a true understanding of the matter if any thing of this kind be urged or made use of against mee.

SWP No. 163.3(Letter of William Phips to the Earl of Nottingham)[February 21 1692]Boston in New England  Febry 21st 1692/3. SirBy the Capn. of the Samuell and Henry I gave an account that att my arrival here I found the Prisons full of people committed upon suspition of witchcraft and that continuall complaints were made to me that many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they cryed out upon severall persons by name as the cause of their torments. The number of these complaints increasing every day by advice of the Lieut Govr. and the Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to try the suspected witches and at that time the generality of the people represented to me as reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of the same. The first in Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest persons of the best prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon and I depended upon the Court for a right method of proceeding in cases of witchcraft. At that time I went to command the army at the Eastern part of the Province for the French and Indians had made an attack upon some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued there for some time but when I returned I  found people much disatisfied at the proceedings of the Court for about Twenty persons were condemned and executed of which number some were thought by many persons to be innocent. The Court still proceeded in the same method of trying them which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons who when they were brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches looked upon them instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous torments but when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their flesh they immediately revived and came to themselves upon [which] they made oath that the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw their shape or spectre come from their bodies which put them to such paines and torments: When I enquired into the matter I was enformed by the Judges that they begun with this but had humane testimony against such as were condemned and undoubted proof of their being witches but at length I found that the Devill did take upon him the shape of Innocent persons and some were accused of whose innocency I was well assured and many considerable persons of unblameable life and conversation were cried out upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr. notwithstanding persisted vigorously in the same method to the great disatisfaction and disturbance of the people untill I put an end to the Court and stopped the proceedings which I did because I saw many innocent persons might otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to give an account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed hoping that for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in England might give such rules and directions as have been practized in England for proceedings in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put an end to the Court there ware at least fifty persons in prison in great misery by reason of the extream cold and their poverty most of them having only spectre evidence against them and their mittimusses being defective I caused some of them to be lett out upon bayle and put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe others and prevent them from perishing in prison upon which some of them were convinced and acknowledged that their former proceedings were too violent and not grounded upon a right foundation but that if they might sit againe they would proceed after another method and whereas Mr. Increase Mathew and severall other Divines did give it as their Judgment that the Devill might afflict in the shape of an innocent person and that the look and touch of the suspected persons was not sufficient proofe against them these things had not the same stress layd upon them as before and upon  this consideration I permitted a spetiall Superior Court to be held at Salem in the County of Essex on the third day of January the Lieut Govr. being Chief Judge. Their method of proceeding being altered all that were brought to tryall to the number of fifety two were cleared saving three and I was enformed by the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the condemned were under the same circumstances or that there was the same reason to clear the three condemned as the rest according to his Judgment. The Deputy Govr. signed a Warrant for their speedy execution and also of five others who were condemned at the former Court of Oyer and terminer but considering how the matter had been managed I sent a reprieve whereby the execucion was stopped untill their Maj. pleasure be signified and declared. The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was inraged and filled with passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a Superior Court then held at Charles Towne and indeed hath from the beginning hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by his warrant hath caused the estates goods and chattles of the executed to be seized and disposed of without my knowledge or consent. The stop put to the first method of proceedings hath dissipated the blak cloud that threatened this Province with destruccion; for whereas this delusion of the Devill did spread and its dismall effects touched the lives and estates of many of their Ma'ties Subjects and the reputation of some of the principall persons here and indeed unhappily clogged and interrupted their Ma'ties affaires which hath been a great vexation to me I have no new complaints but peoples minds before divided and distracted by differing opinions concerning this matter are now well composed.I am (&)SrYor.

SWP No. 167.2(Petition of Twenty-six Andover Men on Behalf of Their Wives and Daughters )[October 18 1692]To his Excellency the Governour and Councill & Representatives now Assembled at Boston. The Humble Address of the ministers and of some of the Inhabitants of Andover. We being deeply sensible of the heavy judgment that the Righteous God hath brought upon this place thought it our duty (after our earnest prayers to the God of Heaven to give us help from our trouble) to lay before this Honourable Assembly our present distressed estate and to crave a redress of our greivances. It is well known that many persons of this Town have been accused of witchcraft by some distempered persons in these parts and upon complaint made have been apprehended and committed to prison. Now though we would not appear as Advocates for any who shall be found guilty  of so horrid a crime but we heartily desire that this place and the whole land may be purged from that great wickedness: yet if any of our #[freinds] friends and neighbours have been misrepresented as tis possible some of them have been; wee would crave leave (if it might be without offence) to speak something in their behalf haveing no other desighn therein then that the truth may appear. We can truly give this Testimony of the most of them belonging to this Town that have been accused that they never gave the least occasion (as we hear of) to their neerest relations or most intimate acquaintance to suspect them of witchcraft. Severall of the women that are accused were members of this church in full Communion and had obtained a good report for their blameless conversation and their walking as becometh woemen professing godliness. But whereas it may be alledged that the most of our people that have been apprehended for witchcraft have upon Examination confessed it. To which we Answer that we have nothing to plead for those that freely and upon conviction own themselves guilty; but we apprehend the case of some of them to be otherwise. for from the information we have had and the discourse some of us have had with the prisoners we have reason to think that the extream urgency that was used with some of them by their friends and others who privately examined them and the fear they were then under hath been an inducement to them to own such things as we cannott since find thay are conscious of; and the truth of what we now declare we judge will in time more plainly appear. And some of them have exprest to their neighbours that it hath been their great trouble that they have wronged themselves and the truth in their confessions.We are also very sensible of the disstressed condition of severall poor familyes on whom this great trouble is fallen; some #[more] of our neighbors are like to be impoverished & ruin'd by the great charge they are at to maintain such of their familyes as are in Prison and by the fees that are demanded of them whose case we pray may be considered. Our troubles which hitherto have been great we foresee are like to continue and increase if other methods be not taken then as yet have been for there are more of our neighb'rs of good reputation & approved integrity who are still accused and complaints have been made against them And we know not who can think himself safe if the Accusations of children and others who are under a Diabolicall influence shall be received against persons of good fame. We thought meet also to Signifye that not only persons of good creditt among our selves but some Honorable & worthy men of other places do suffer in their names by the acusations of afflicted people in this Town Thus haveing given your Honors some account of our present troubles we crave pardon for our boldness in this Address and humbly pray this Honored Court to take into their serious consideration our low and distressed estate: And that the only wise God may bless yo'r counsels & Endeavors for the welfare of his people shall be the prayer of                   Your humble PetitionersDated at Andov'r  18'th Oct. 1692.   *Timothy Osgood *Samuel Osgoode*Samuel Martin*William Chandler                                                   *William abbutt                                                   *Thomas Chandler                                                   *Christopher osgood                                                   *Ebenezer Barker                                                   *Stephen Barnott                                                   *Joseph Marble                                                   *Ephraim Daviss                                                   *Andrew peeters                                                   *Walter Rice                                                   *hooker osgood                                                   *Francis Dane sen'r                                                   *Thomas Barnard                                                   *John Osgood                                                   *Thomas Johnson*Nathaniel Dane                                                   *Hopestil Tiler                                                   *Ephraim Steevens                                                   *John Aslebee                                                   *James Frie                                                   *Joseph Willson                                                   *Joseph Steevens                                                   *Thomas Chandler Jun'r ( Mass.

And more Especially respecting our selves in this Province in that God is pleased still to go on in diminishing our substance cutting short our Harvest; blasting our most promising Undertakings; more ways than one Unsettling of us; and by his more immediate Hand snatching away many out of our Embraces by suddain & violent deaths; even at this time when the Sword is devouring so many; both at home and abroad; and that after many Days of publick and Solemn addressing of Him. And altho considering the many Sins prevailing in the midst of us We cannot but wonder at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Rebukes; yet we cannot but also Fear that there is somthing still wanting to accompany our Suplications. And doubtless there are some particular Sins which God is angry with our Israel for that have not been duely seen and resented by us about which God expects to be sought if ever He turn again our Captivity.Wherefore its Commandd & Apointd that Thursday the Fourteenth of January next be observed as aDay of Prayer with Fasting throughout this Province; strictly forbidding all Servile Labour thereon.

SWP No. 172.7(Petition of Ministers from Essex County)[July 8 1703]To his Excellency the Governor Council and Representatives of the Province of the Massachusets Bay in Generall Court Assembled June 1703 The Address of severall Ministers of the County of Essex. Whereas in the year 1692 some of our neighbours of a good conversation were apprehended and imprisoned upon suspition of Witchcraft upon the complaint of some young persons under Diabolicall molestations; and upon their Tryall at the Court at Salem were condemned; great weight being layd upon the evidence of the Afflicted persons their Accusers Sentence of Death was Executed on severall of them others were Reprieved. But since it is apparent and hath been Acknowledged that there were Errors and mistakes in the aforesaid Tryalls; and notwithstanding the care and conscientious endeavour of the Honorable Judges to do the thing that is right: yet there is great reason to fear that Innocent persons then suffered and that God may have a controversy with the Land upon that account. We would therefore humbly propose to the consideration of this Honored Court whether something may not and ought not to be publickly done to clear the good name and reputation of some who have suffered as aforesaid against whom there was not as is supposed sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of such a crime and for whom there are good grounds of charity. Some of the condemned persons aforesaid and others in behalf of their Relations who have suffered have lately Petitioned this Honoured Court upon this Account. We pray that their case may be duely considered. Thomas Barnard*Joseph Green*William Hubbard*Benjamin Rolfe*Samuel Cheever*Zech.

SWP No. 172.10(Declaration of Mary Osgood  Mary Tyler[January 3 1693]We whose names are under-written inhabitants of Andover; whenas that horrible and tremendous judgment beginning at Salem village in the year 1692 by some called witchcraft first breaking forth at Mr. Parris's house several young persons being seemingly afflicted did accuse several persons for afflicting them and many there believing it so to be we being informed that if a person was sick the afflicted person could tell what or who was the cause of that sickness: Joseph Ballard  of Andover his wife being sick at the same time he either from himself or by the advice of others fetched two of the persons called the afflicted persons from Salem village to Andover which was the beginning of that dreadful calamity that befel us in Andover believing the said accusations to be true sent for the said persons to come together to the meeting house in Andover the afflicted persons being there. After Mr. Barnard had been at prayer we were blindfolded and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons they being in their fits and falling into their fits at our coming into their presence as they said; and some led us and laid our hands upon them and then they said they were well and that we were guilty of afflicting them: Whereupon we were all seized as prisoners by a warrant from the Justice of the peace and forthwith carried to Salem. And by reason of that sudden surprizal we knowing ourselves altogether innocent of the crime we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed and consternated and affrighted even out of our reason. and our nearest and dearest relations seeing us in that dreadful condition and knowing our great danger apprehended there was no other way to save our lives as the case was then circumstanced but by our confessing ourselves to be such and such persons as the afflicted represented us to be they out of tenderness and pity persuaded us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that confession that it is said we made was no other than what was suggested to us by some gentlemen they telling us that we were witches and they knew it and we knew it which made us think that it was so; and our understandings our reason our faculties almost gone we were not capable of judging of our condition; as also the hard measures they used with us rendered us incapable of making our defence but said any thing and every thing which they desired and most of what we said was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Some time after when we were better composed they  telling us what we had confessed we did profess that we were innocent and ignorant of such things; and we hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his confession and quickly after condemned and executed some of us were told we were going after Wardwell.Mary Osgood Mary TilerDeliverance Dane Abigail Barker Sarah WilsonHannah Tiler.( Thomas Hutchinson  History of Massachusetts-Bay II 31-32 ),1693,January,172

We were at the whole charge of provideing for her dureing her Imprisonm't in Salem and Boston for the space of almost four months 2. And also we spent much time and made many Journys to Boston & Salem & other places in order to have vindicated her Innocency. 3 And altho we produced plentifull testimony that my honoured and Dear mother had led a blameless life from her youth up -- yet she was condemned and executed upon such Evidence as is now Generally thought to be Insufficient which may be seen in the court record of her tryall. 4 And so her Name and the name of her Posterity lyes under reproach the removeing of which reproach is the principal thing wherein we desire restitution. 5 And as we know not how to express our loss of such a mother in such a way; so we know not how to compute our charge but shall leave it to the judgm't. of others and shall not be critical but ready to receive such a satisfaction as shall be by the Honourable Court judged sufficient -- so Praying God to Guide unto such Methods as may be for his Glory and the good of this land -- I rest Your Honours In all christian obedienceSalem  Septem. 13. 1710*Sam'll Nurse                                 In the name of my                                 brethrenAltho fourty pounds would not repair my Loss and damage in my Estate yet I shall be satisfyd if may be allowed five and twenty pounds.
