12,1753-06-19,At Colledge a very warm morning at 11 Disputed  on this question (viz) systema Copernicanum est verum mundi systema.
13,1753-06-20,At Colledge a most Charming and Beautifull Scene is this morning displayed. All nature  wears a Chearfull garb after so plentifull a Shower as we were favoured with the Last night receving an additionall lustre from the  sweet influences of the Sun. -- This Day I (in the religious Phylosopher) read the following experiment (viz)  that the filings of iron mix'd with sulphur and kneaded to a Dough By the addittion of Cold water will in a few hours Become warm  and at last Be set on fire. Which is undoubtedly true and if so I think that  it affords a very probable method of solving the phnomina of subterraneous fires. For it is highly  probable that there are abundance of the particles of iron Sulphur and water  which (By the flux of water perhaps in the subterraneous Caverns) may Be  Brought together and then it appears By the precedent experiment that this  effect (viz a fire) will Be produced. At 2 o'Clock heard Mr. Winthrop's lecture in the Hall in which he  was employed in evincing the sphroidall form of the earth which he Did from  the vibrations of pendula the precession of the a equinox and from actual  mensuration of Degrees at the quinox and the  poles. -- After which I extracted the following Hydrostatical Laws from the  religious Phylosopher (viz) 1st: if a Body is to  be Carried upwards in any liquor an equall Bulk of  said liquor must gravitate or weigh more than such a Body.   3      2ndly.  that in order to Cause a Body to sink in a liquor an equal Bulk of said liquor  must weigh less than the Body. 3rdly. if you would have the Body neither to  rise or fall But preserve it's place in any part of the liquor an equal  quantity of the said liquor must weigh equally with the Body.

18,1753-06-25,At Colledge a very rainy morning at 11 o'Clock  Disputed from the question assigned us last tuesday  But on which we Did not then Dispute By reason of Mr. Mayhews Being employed in taking an account of  the Books and other things Contained in the Library in order to the Printing a  new Catalogue thereof.

24,1754-02-01,In the winter of 1754 we had no snow at all save a smattering or two  But perpetuall rains and warm weather thro 'ought the whole.
25,1754-03-02,Beg. [Beginning of March] Had a small flurry of snow.
26,1754-03-08,A Clowdy morning. I am now reading  my lord Orrerys letters to his son  Concerning Dr. Swift and his writings which for softness and  delicacy of style accuracy and serenity of sentiment are absolutely  inimitable. Reading also the last volume of Monsieur Rollin's  Belles Lettres which are worth their  weight in gold. -- for his excellent reflections on every remarkable event that  occurs in history he informs his readers of the true source   5      of  every action and instructs them in the method of forming themselves  upon the models of virtue to be met with in History.
27,1754-03-17,Kept sabath at  Cambridge. March about the middle.
28,1754-03-18,In the Evening we had several very sharp flashes of lightning attended with  a Distant grumbling of thunder.
29,1754-03-19,This morning is beyond description Beautyfull  the Skie bespangled with Clouds which shed a lustre on us by the refraction of the rays of light  together with the healthy and enlivening air which was purifyed By the thunder afford most spirited materials  for Contemplation. The gaiety of the weather is equally delightfull to the phylosopher Poet and the man of Pleasure.  The Phylosopher finds his passions all  Calm and serene and Pliable so that he finds no Difficulty in  subjecting them to the subserviency of his reason he can now contemplate all  the gaudy appearances of nature and like Pythagoras bring  Phylosophy down from heaven and make her  conversible to men. The Poet thinks this the Best time to Converse with his  muse and Consequently gives himself up wholly to her directions. His whole soul  is at her disposall and he no more retains the  government of himself. While the man of pleasure find such delicacys arising from the objects of sence as are adapted to produce the highest sensations of  delight in him.   6    
30,1754-04-01,Then Mr. Winthrop began a Course of Experimental
32,1754-04-03,The second lecture wherein which was wholly taken up in  explaining the Propertys of the Centers of gravity and motion which were  applyed to the instruments Cheifly in use in Common life such as the lever  pulley Ballance axis in peritrocheo &c. But  the Ballance was chiefly principally  insisted on. The reason of it was fully explained and the method of weighing  viz the distances of the Bodys from the Center of  motion must be precisely in a reciprocall  proportion of their quantitys of matter or  weights always alowing for the weight of the Beam  on which they are suspended as well as friction and the falsity of the  supposition that radii proceeding from the center of the earth are  parrellel. Mr.  Winthrop also demonstrated to us that all the advantages arising from  [  ] any of the engines in use resulted from the  different possion [position] of them with relation to force  and velocity thence he shew 'd the famous problem  of Archimedes viz to move any weight however great by any  force however small. -- I had like to have forgot that he applied the doctrines  of the center of gravity to the heavenly Bodys  shewing us the affections of the sun and planets  with respect to their Centers of gravity and instructed us in the manner of  finding the Common Center of gravity of any 2 of 'em e.g. earth and moon viz  By this proportion as the quantitys of matter in  [  ] Both added together is to the quantity of  matter in the one separtely so is the distance of  their centers to the distance of the Center of the other from the Common  Center sought. And to find the common Center of gravity of 3 4 or 5 or any  given number of Bodys having found the common center  of any 2 from that said Center draw a line to another of said  Bodys and find the common Center of gravity of these  two respecting the   12      common Center of gravity of the former 2 as a  Body containing a quantity of matter equal to Both said Bodys.
33,1754-04-05,The theory of the Ballance scales steel -- yard  c. and all and the 3 species of lever's continued to which  (viz) the lever he referred allmost all the  instruments in life and [  ] universally. To make a quilibrium the product of product  of the quantity of matter in the weight multiplyed into its distance from the Center of motion  must be equal to the quantity of matter in the power multiplyed into it's distance from said Center.
34,1754-04-06,The phnomina of The nature of the Pulley axis in  peritrochaeo and inclined Plane explained which all depend on the laws before  laid down (viz) that the quantity of matter in the weight bears the same  proportion to the quantity of matter in the power as the distance of the power  from the Center of motion to the distance of the weight from said Center.
35,1754-04-08,The Theory of simple machines and in particular of the inclined plane of  the wedge and screw and other machines compounded of these simple ones  finish'd.
36,1754-04-09,Sir Isaac Newtons three laws of nature proved and  illustrated together with the application of them to the planets which are  kept in their orbits by two forces acting upon them viz that of gravity and  that which is call'd its their  Centrifugal force whereby it they strives to recede from  the Center of their orbits and fly off there from in tangents.   13    
37,1754-04-10,The theory of Centrifugal forces continued and aplyed to the Cases of the planets and from this  Centrifugal force Mr. Winthrop confuted  the hypothesis of vortices from this also arises the spheroidal form of the  earth.
38,1754-04-11,But to be plain I am beginning Life anew. I have new Friendships to make  new Employments to follow new Concerns Prospects and Studies opening before  me. [  ] And now I have mentioned Studies I find  my self entering an unlimited Field. A Field in which  Demosthenes Cicero and others of immortal Fame have exulted before me! A  Field which incloses the whole Circle of Science and Literature the History  Wisdom and Virtue of all ages. -- Shall I dare to expatiate here in full  Career like the nobler Animals that range at large or shall I blindly  basely creep like the mole or the weezell? -- Tell  me.
39,1758-10-01,He nourishes a Wound in his Veins and is consumed with a blind hidden fire.  -- Warner FessendenClark Cranch Quincy. All of  them [cherished?] by their incessant Thinking the Wound in  their Hearts and all consume with a hidden internal flame.   16    
40,1758-10-05,I have read about 10 s in Justinian and Translated about 4 s into  English. This is the whole of my Days Work. I have smoaked chatted trifled loitered away this whole day  almost. By much the greatest Part of this day has been spent in unloading a  Cart in cutting oven Wood in making and recruiting my own fire in eating  nuts and apples in drinking   2      Tea cutting and smoaking Tobacco and in chatting with the Doctor's Wife  at their House and at this. Chores Chatt Tobacco Tea Steal away Time. But  I am resolved to translate Justinian and his Commentators Notes by day light  and read Gilberts Tenures by Night till I am master of both  and I will meddle with no other Book in this Chamber on a Week day. On a Sunday  I will read the Inquiry into the Nature of the human Soul and for Amusement I  will sometimes read Ovids Art of Love to Mrs. Savel. -- This shall be my Method. -- I have read  Gilberts 1st Section of feuds this evening but am not a  Master of it.
41,1758-10-06,Rose about sun rise. Unpitched a Load of Hay. Translated a Leaves more of  Justinian and in the afternoon walked to Deacon Webbs then  round by the  Mill Pond home. Smoaked a Pipe with Webb at the  Drs. and am now about reading over again Gilberts section of  feudal Tenures.
42,1758-10-07,Read in Gilbert. Rode with Webb to  Mr. Cranche's. Dined and drank Tea with him and then home.  Saturday night.
43,1758-10-08,If nothing is Matter which has not this antiactive Principle then human  Minds are not matter for they have no such Principle. We are conscious that we  can begin and end motion of ourselves.   3      If he argues a Posteriori  from Experiments he can pretend only to Probability. For Unless he was certain  that he had made the Experiment and found the Property in every Particle of  Matter that ever was created he could not be certain that there was no  Particle in the World without this Property tho he  had tried all but one and found that they had it. We have tried but a few  Parcells of Matter. The Utmost we can say is that all we have tried are  inactive. [  ] But for Argument sake I will deny that all  the Parcels that we have tried have this Property. On the Contrary I will say  that all have a motive Power downwards. Powder has an Active Power springing  every Way &c. Thus Experiment is turned against the Doctrine. I cant yet  see how he will prove all matter Anti inactive a Priori from Properties of  matter before known essential with which he must shew  this to be necessarily connected.
44,1758-10-09,Read in Gilberts Tenures. I must and will make that Book  familiar to me.
45,1758-10-10,Read in Gilbert. I read him slowly but I gain Ideas and  Knowledge as I go along which I dont always when I read.
46,1758-10-11,Rode to  Boston. Conversed with Ned Quincy and  Saml. Peter Chardon  c. By the Way Peter Chardon is a promising Youth. He aspires and will  reach to a considerable Height. He has a sense of the Dignity and Importance of  his Profession that of the Law. He has a just Contempt of the idle incurious  Pleasure hunting young fellows of the Town who pretend to study Law. He scorns  the Character and he aims at a nobler. He talks of exulting in an unlimited  field of natural civil and common Law talks of nerving sharpening the mind  by the Study of Law and Mathematicks quotes  Locks Conduct of the Understanding and transcribes Points of  Law into a Common-Place Book on Locks Modell. This  fellows Thoughts are not employed on Songs and Girls nor his Time on flutes  fiddles Concerts and Card Tables. He will make something.
47,1758-10-12,Examined the Laws of this Province concerning Pads Cattle fences &c.  and read in Gilbert. This small volume will take me a  fortnight but I will be master of it.
48,1758-10-13,4. It cant be called an indirect Way of delivering his Creatures out of  Pound [  ] to [  ] pay or tender the  Poundkeeper his fees and demand and receive his Cattle of him when he has  unlocked and opened the Pound Gate and turned the Creatures out? So that it  will not admit a Quere whether Lambert is liable to an Action  for receiving his Horses of the Pound keeper. Tis plain I think he is not.
49,1758-10-16,Read a few s in Gilbert. I proceed very slowly.
50,1758-10-17,I have not Spirits and Presence of mind to hunt up objects seek  out scenes of Observation and to watch critically the Air Countenances  Actions and Speeches of old men and young men of old Women and young Girls  of Physicians and Priests of old Maids and Batchelors. I should chatter with a  Girl and watch her Behaviour her answers to  Questions the workings of Vanity and other Passions in her Breast. But objects  before me dont suggest proper Questions to ask and proper Observations to  make so dull and confused at present is my mind. -- Betsy  Niles affects to trip lightly across the floor to act with a  Sprightly Air and to be polite. But she is under Restraint and awe from her  Unacquaintance with Company. Saw Lawyer  Thachers Father at Mr. Niles's. He said old  Coll. Thatcher of Barnstable was an  excellent man. He was a very holy man. I used to love to hear him pray. He was  a Counsellor and a Deacon. I have heard him say that of all his Titles that  of a Deacon he tho't the most honourable. - [Query] is he a new  Light? Old Age has commonly a sense of the Importance and Dignity of Religion.  I dare say he is not well pleased with his son's professing the Law. He had  rather have him a Deacon.
51,1758-10-19,What Passion is most active and prevalent in Dr.  Savel's mind? The Desire of Money. He retails Sugar by the Pound  [  ] by the bunch Pins Pen knifes to save these  Articles in his family and   8      neat a few Shillings Profit. He  [  ] makes poor People who are in his Debt  [  ] pay him in Labour. He  bargains with his Debtors in the 2 other Parishes for Wood which he sends to  the Landing Place and to Dr. Marshes. Thus by practice of  Physick by trading in trading and  bargaining and scheming he picks up a Subsistance for his family and gathers  very gradually Additions to his Stock. But this is low. The same Application  and scheming in his Profession would raise and spread him a Character procure  him profitable Business and make his fortune. But by this contemptible  Dissipation of mind among Pins Needles Tea Snuff Boxes Vendues Loads of  Wood day labour &c. he is negligent of the Theory  of his Profession and will live and die unknown. -- These driveling souls oh!  He aims not at fame only at a Living and a fortune!
52,1758-10-21,Rose with the sun. took the horse Brot up the Horse and took a  Ride over  Penns Hill as far as John Haywards in a cold  keen blustering N. Wester. Returned and breakfasted. I feel  brac'd as if the cold [  ] clear Air had given a Spring  to the System. -- I am now sett down to the Laws  relating to naval Trade and Commerce. Let me inquire of the next Master of a  Ship that I see what is a Bill of Lading what the Pursers Book. What Invoices  they keep. What Account they keep of Goods received on Board and of Goods  delivered out at another Port &c.
53,1758-10-22,Some Voyages We have nothing to do but receive Goods on board keep them  safely on the Voyage and deliver them safely to the Merchant to whom they are  directed. But sometimes we make Trading Voyages. We carry a Cargo of Goods to  sell for money or exchange for other Goods in the most profitable manner we  can.   9      Here we keep a regular Account make the owners Debtors for  Goods that we buy or receive and give them Credit for Goods that we deliver  out. . [ ] [ This notation was added to the original  manuscript  by Charles Francis Adams who  many of 's   entries into other manuscript volumes. ]
54,1758-10-24,Rode to  Boston. Arrived about 1/2 after 10. Went into the Court House  and sett down by Mr. Paine  att the Lawyers Table. I felt Shy under Awe and concern  for Mr. Gridley Mr. Prat  Mr. Otis Mr.  Kent and Mr. Thatcher were all present and looked  sour. I had no Acquaintance with any Body but Paine and  Quincy and they took but little Notice. However I attended  Court Steadily all Day and at night went to Consort with Samll.  Quincy and Dr. Gardiner.  There I saw the most Spacious and elegant Room the gayest Company of Gentlemen  and the finest Row of Ladies that ever I saw. But the weather was so dull and  I so disordered that I could not make one half the observations that I wanted  to make.
55,1758-10-25,I asked his Advice about studying Greek. He answered it is a matter of meer  Curiosity. -- After this long and familiar Conversation we went to Court.  Attended all Day and in the Evening I went to ask Mr.  Thatchers Concurrence with the Bar. Drank Tea and spent the whole  Evening upon original sin Origin of Evil the Plan of the Universe and at  last upon Law. He says He is sorry that he neglected to keep a common Place  Book when he began to study Law and he is half a mind to begin now.  Thatcher thinks this County is full.   11    
56,1758-10-26,Let me remember to mark in my Memorandum Book the Names of the Cases and  the Terms and Points of Law that occur in each Case to look these Terms and  Points in the Books at Otis's Prats or any  other office and to digest and write down the whole in the Evening at my  Lodgings. This will be reaping some real Advantage by my Attendance on the  Courts and without this the Observations that I may make will lie in total  Confusion in my mind.
57,1758-10-27,All Spent in absolute Idleness or what is worse gallanting the Girls.
58,1758-10-31,Set down and recollected my self and read a  little in Van Muyden a little in naval Trade and  Commerce.
59,1758-11-01,Read a little in Van Muyden and a little in naval Trade  and Commerce.
60,1758-11-02,Rode as far as Smelt Brook. Breakfasted made my fire and am now set down to  Van Muyden in Earnest. His latin is easy his definitions are  pretty clear and his Divisions of the subject are judicious.
61,1758-11-05,Sam has the utmost Reason to be grateful to Mr.  Pratt. He will have an opportunity 100 times better than Mr.  Prat had of rising [  ] into the Practice and  Reputation of the Law. I want to see and hear Sam at the Bar.  I want to know how he will succeed. I am concerned for him. The  Govr. a likes Sam much better  than Ned. [  ] He has seen or heard some  of Neds freaks. This is a [  ] Partiality  in favor of one Child and against another quite indecent in a father. Tis great  Weakness to expose himself so before Strangers.
62,1758-11-06,Went to Town. attended upon Court. Went to Mr.  Gridleys office but he had not returned to Town from  Brookline. Went again. Not returned. Attended Court till after  12 and began to grow uneasy expecting that Quincy would be  sworn and I have no Patron when Mr. Gridly made his  Appearance and on sight of me whispered to Mr. Prat  Dana Kent  Thatcher &c. about me. Mr. Prat said no  Body knew me. Yes says Gridley I have tried him he is a  very sensible Fellow. -- At last He rose up and bowed to his right Hand and  said Mr. Quincy when Quincy  [  ] rose up then bowed to me Mr.  Adams when I walked out. May it please your Honours I have 2 young Gentlemen Mr. Q.  and Mr. Adams to present for the Oath of an Attorney. Of  Mr. Q. it is sufficient for me to say he has lived 3 Years  with Mr. Prat. Of Mr. Adams as he is unknown  to your Honours It is necessary to say that he has  lived between 2 and 3 Years with Mr. Putnam of  Worcester has a good Character from him and all others who  know him and that he was with me the other day several Hours and I take it he  is qualified to study the Law by his scholarship and that he has made a very  considerable a very great Proficiency in the Principles of the Law and  therefore that the Clients Interest may be safely intrusted in his Hands. I  therefore recommend him with the Consent of the Bar to your Honors for the  Oath. Then Mr. Prat said 2 or 3 Words and the Clerk was  ordered to swear us. After the Oath Mr. Gridley took me by the  Hand and wished me much joy and recommended me to the Bar. I shook  Hands with the Bar and received their Congratulations and invited them over  to Stones to drink some Punch. Where the most of us resorted and had a very  chearful [Chat?].   14    
63,1758-12-05,Let me search for the Clue which Led great Shakespeare  into the Labyrinth of mental Nature! Let me examine how men think.  Shakespeare had never seen in real Life Persons under the  Influence of all those Scenes of Pleasure and distress which he has described  in his Works but he imagined how a Person of such a Character would behave in  such Circumstances by analogy from the Behaviour  of others that were most like that Character in [  ]  nearly similar Circumstances which he had seen.   16    
64,1758-12-18,Heard Parson Wibirt exert his Casuistry to J.  Spear. Warned him against selling his [drowned?] Sheep  for merchantable Mutton. It was not so nutritive nor palatable as Mutton  butchered [  ] and dressed and therefore was not worth  the same Price and it would be an Imposition and a Cheat that his Conscience  must disapprove to describe it and sell it as good Mutton. He could not  without [ sentence unfinished. ]   17    
65,1758-12-20,I am this forenoon resuming the Study of Van Muyden. I  begin at the 99th .
66,1758-12-21,Yesterday and to day I have read loud  Tullius 4. Orations against Cataline.  [  ] The Sweetness and Grandeur of his sounds and the  Harmony of his Numbers give Pleasure enough to reward the Reading if one  understood none of his meaning. Besides I find it a noble Exercise.  [  ] It exercises my Lungs raises my Spirits opens my  Porrs quickens the Circulations and so contributes  much to Health.
67,1758-12-26,Being the Evening after Christmas the Dr. and I spent the Evening with  Mr. Cleverly and  Major Miller. Mr.  Cleverly was chearful alert sociable and  complaisant. So much good sense and knowledge so much good Humour and Contentment and so much Poverty are not to be  found in any other House I believe in this Province. I am amazed that a man of  his Inginuity and sprightliness can be so shiftless. But what avails a noisy  fame a plentiful fortune and great figure and Consideration in the World?  Neither Prat nor Gridley  Mayhew nor Eliot  Stockbridge nor Hersey appear more easy and  happy with all their wealth and Reputation than he with neither. Major  Miller was sedate but the Conversation was not to his Taste. He began  to tell what this and that fellow said what Coll. Oliver did at  Dorchester and what he did at  Deadham but he said very little on the whole. Both of them took  unused freedoms with Coll.  Quincy and his Brother.  They are determined to esteem them both Knaves and fools.
68,1758-12-29,An opinion will spread among the People that I have not Cunning enough to  cope with Lambert. I should endeavour at my first setting out to possess the People  with an Opinion of my subtilty and Cunning. But  this affair certainly looks like a strong Proof of the Contrary.
69,1758-12-30,Andrew Oliver is a very sagacious  Trifler. He can decypher with surprizing  Penetration and Patience any Thing wrote in signs whether English Latin or  French. But to what Purpose? Tis like great skill and Dexterity in Gaming used  only for Amuzement. With all his Expertness he never wins any Thing. But this  is his Way to fame. One man would be a famous Orator another a famous  Physician another a famous Phylosopher or a  4th a famous Dancer and he would be a famous Decypherer. But I am quite  content with the 24 Letters without inventing all the possible Marks that might  signify the same Things. Ned [Quincy] is  learning to be such another Nugator Sagax an artificial arrangement of Dots  and Squares.   20    
70,1759-01-01,O. Pain [  ] aims at so many Things  but especially at getting Cash that he will be distracted. He pursues Cash  with all his Hart and soul. He writes well and tells a  very droll story but he is very peevish fretful odd tempered. He thinks  himself in high favour with the Ladies but he little  thinks how he is blasted sometimes.
71,1759-01-02,Wibirt [  ] exposes very freely to me  his Disposition the past and present state of his mind his susceptibility of  Impressions from Beauty &c. [  ] his Being amourous  and inclined to love his Want of Resolution to Court his Regard fondness  for O. his Intimacy [  ] and  dalliance with her &c. He has if I mistake not a good many  [  ] half born Thoughts of courting  O.
72,1759-02-01,I intend a journey to  Worcester to morrow. How many  observations shall I make on the People at West Town and  Worcester and how [  ] many new  Hints rules Ideas Hints Rules of Law and Eloquence shall I  acquire before I return? Let my journal answer this Question after my  Return.   29    
73,1759-02-02,I have read several Letters this afternoon and Evening in the Turkish  Spy.
74,1759-02-11,I spent one Evening this Week at Billy Belchers. I sat  book in Hand on one side of the fire while Dr. Wendell  Billy Belcher and Stephen Cleverly and  another young Gentleman sat in silence round the Card Table all the Evening.  Two Evenings I spent att Samll. Quincys  in the same manner Dr. Gardiner Henry Q.  Ned Q. and S.Q. all playing Cards the whole  Evening. This is the wise and salutary amuzement  that young Gentlemen take every Evening in this Town playing Cards drinking  Punch and Wine Smoaking Tobacco swearing &c.  while 100 of the best Books lie on the shelves Desks and Chairs in the same  room. This is not Misspence of Time. This is a wise a profitable Improvement  of Time. Cards and Back Gammon are fashionable Diversions. I'le be curst if  any young fellow can study in this town. What Pleasure can a young Gentleman  who is capable of thinking take in playing Cards? It gratifies none of the  Senses nor Sight [  ] Hearing taste smell feeling. It  can entertain the Mind only by hushng its Clamours. Cards Back Gammon are the  great antidotes to Reflection to thinking that cruel Tyrant within Us. What  Learning or Sense are we to expect from young Gentlemen in whom a fondness  for Cards &c. outgrows and choaks the Desire of Knowledge?   33

105,1760-06-25,At one of the Clock we took our Mutton and Cyder  under the shade of a fine Tree and laid our Provisions on a large flat stone  which answered for Table Dish and Plate and then we dined expecting with much  Pleasure an easy sail Home before the Wind which then bread fresh at East.  After Diner we boarded and hoisted sail and sailed very pleasantly a Mile  when the Wind died away into a Clock Calm and left us to row against the Tide  and presently against the Wind too for that sprung up at south right a Head of  us and blew afresh. This was hard work. Doubtful what Course to steer whether  to  Nut Island or to  Half Moon or to  Hangmans Island or to  Sunken Island Coll.  Q. grew sick which determined us to go ashore at  Hangmans for that was the nearest.

When the Coll. [  ] awoke and found himself strengthened and inspirited we  rowed away under Half Moon and then hoisted sail and run home. So much for  the Day of Pleasure The fishing frolick the Water  frolick. We had none of the Pleasure of Angling very  little of the Pleasure of Sailing. We had much of the fatigue of Rowing and  some of the Vexation of Disappointment. However the Exercise and the Air and  smell of salt Water is wholesome.   26

115,1760-07-25,The jury gave a Verdict for Chambers in this Case.   36    
116,1760-07-26,This Bond has been at [least] once and an half if not  twice paid. The Case is this. About 15 Years ago the Plaintiffs sold a tract  [of] Land containing 30 Acres within such and such  Boundaries to one Tower for 750 and He together with the present  Defendants became jointly bound to the Plaintiffs in 10 different Bonds of  which this is one for the Payment of the Money. But in the Time of it a  suspicion arose that those Bounds did not include 30 Acres and least they  should not an Agreement was made and committed to Writing that the Land should  be surveyed and if it was found to fall short the Deficiency should be  deducted from some of these Bonds. Accordingly the Land was afterwards  surveyed and found to fall short 7 Acres and an half which at the  in Proportion of to the Price of the whole  amounted to about the Value of this Bond. All the other Bonds have been  discharged and taken up and this was set against the Deficiency of Land. But  Besides all this [  ] at least one half of it has been  paid another Way. For one of these [  ] Obligers carried  the Money to Hollis and had 1/2 of what was due upon every  Bond in his Hands callculated and paid him down his Money and  Hollis promised to indorse one half upon every Bond that was  left: yet this has never been indorsed and  Hollis has assurance enough to sue for this whole Bond. The  Defendants have been extreemely careless and  negligent. Sometimes they paid Money abroad and took no Receipts but relied  on his Honour   37      to indorse it when he went  home. They even left the Agreement that obliged him to make up the wanting  Land in Hollis's own Hands after the Land was surveyed they  left the Plan and survey in his Hands in short there has been the Utmost  Simplicity and Inattention on their Part in every Part of all these  Transactions and there have not been fewer Proofs of Artifice secresy and  Guile I must say Guile on the Part of Hollis for He always  avoided giving Receipts he never would suffer any 3d Person to be present  when he did Business. They sometimes would carry with them a  Neighbour [who] understood  Numbers better than they to calculate for them and see that they were not  injured but whenever they did so Hollis would never do any  Business with them and at last had the Assurance to tell them that he never  would do any Business with them if they brought any Body with them as long as  he lived. So that by one Artifice and another we have been led on to pay I  suppose 1500 for 750 and what is worse than all the rest the Deed he  gave is accidentally lost. Of this Hollis got a Hint and has  since sold it to another Person. This Hollis has  [  ] mortgaged this very Land to  Mr. Gouldthwat the Clerk of this  Court since he found We had lost our Deed. Yet he has the assurance to sue  this [Bond?]. We have offered him to relinquish his obligation  to make good the deficient Land and pay him the 1/2 of this Bond if he will  execute a new Deed of the Land but he cant do that. He has sold it.   38

119,1760-08-12,Dana asked next what Number of Carters Boatmen  Shipbuilders &c. were ever employed at a Time at that Landing Place? I  answered half a dozen Carters perhaps. But my Answer should have been this. At  some times there are 3 or 4. or half a dozen Ship Carpenters and it is  possible there may have been 2 or 3 Boats at that Wharf at a Time which will  require 1/2 dozen Boatmen and [  ] there has been perhaps  40 Carts in a day with stones and Wood and Lumber but these Carts are coming  and going all Day long so that it is a rare thing to see half a dozen Carts  there at a time. In short there is so much Business done there as to   43      render one Tavern necessary but there is not so much Business  there is no such Concourse of Travellers no such Multitudes of busy People at  that Landing as to need all this Cluster of Taverns. One Tavern and one  Retailer was tho't by the select Men quite  sufficient for that Place. They have Appointed one of each and pray that your  Honors would [  ] recognize no more.
120,1760-08-19,This fine speech was Prats. Yet he is sometimes of opinion  that all these Sectaries ought to turn Churchmen and that a Uniform  Establishment ought to take place through the whole Nation.  [  ] I have heard him say that We had better all of us  come into the Church than pretend to overturn it &c. Thus it is that fine  Speechmakers are sometimes for Uniformity sometimes for Variety and  Toleration. They dont speak for the Truth or Weight but for the Smartness  and and Novelty singularity of their speech. However I heard him  make two Observations that pleased me much more. One was that  [  ] People in Years never suppose that young People have  any judgment. Another Was (when a Deposition was produced taken by  Parson Wells with a very incorrect Caption a Caption without  any certificate of mention of the Cause in which it was to be used  or certifying that the Adverse Party was present or notifyed) he observed that  the   45      Parson could not take a Caption to save his  Life and that he knew too much to learn any Thing.
121,1760-10-07,G. says that an Indenture for the Year 1758  att a certain Rent and the Lessees Continuance in the  House and the Lessors Permission to continue in the House thro the Year 1759 without any new Indenture or any  Contract or Conversation about [  ] any Rent is  presumptive Evidence that Each Party intended the Rent should continue the  same. The Lessees Continuance in the House without taking the Pains of going  to the Lessor to treat about new Terms is sufficient Evidence of his  Consent Satisfaction with the old Terms and of his Consent to pay  the old Rent. And the Lessors Permission of his Tenant to continue in the  House without taking the Pains to make a new Contract is sufficient Evidence  of his satisfaction with the Terms and old Terms and of his  Consent that they should continue.   56    
122,1760-10-09,I do not know nor is it possible for your Honours  to determine what Reason induced the Plantiff to  renounce this suit. Whether it was the insolvency or whether  because the Estate is insolvent or because he had no Cause of Action or  because his Action was mislayed or because his Writ was bad which by the Way  is very probable considering who drew it that determined the  Plantiff not to enter this Action I cannot say  and your Honours cannot determine. It appears to your  Honours that the Defendant has been vexed and  distressed by this summons that she has been obliged to take a journey to this  Town and to attend upon this Court where it appears there is nothing for her  to answer to. All this appears. What Motive induced the Plantiff to drop his Action does not appear and  therefore We have a Right to Costs. As Things are Circumstanced I will own  that had this Action been commenced by any Gentleman at this Bar I would have  dispensed [with] this Complaint but it was drawn by a petty  fogging Deputy Sheriff against whom I know it is my Duty and I think it is my  Interest to take all legall Advantages. And he himself cannot   57      think it hard as he has taken both illegal and iniquitous Advantages against  me. Therefore I pray your Honours Judgment for Costs.  -- Q. If this Action should be entered what must be done with it? Continued  or dismissed?-A Motion must be made for a Continuance or a Dismission.
123,1760-10-11,Neals Action is entered so that I have two Actions to  defend by Pleas in Bar and three of the Actions I entered are to be defended  Clark is to Plead in Abatement and Tirrell  and Thayer are I suppose to plead to issue.  Clark gave a Note of Hand to Captn. Brackett in his Life time and after his  Death on a Reckoning with the Administratrix [  ] a  Ballance was found due to the Estate upon Book  and for which he gave a new Note to the Widow as Administratrix. Now  I have laid both these Notes in one Declaration in Conformity to the Province  Law which requires forbids two Bills of Cost upon Instruments  Bonds Bills Notes &c. executed by the same Party and made payable to one  and the same Person and put in suit at the same Time. Dana  pleads in Abatement that these Notes tho executed  by the same Party were not made payable to one and the same Person. The first  was made payable to Bracket and the second was made payable to his Wife-and  cites 3rd. Salkeld 202.  A. owed to B..20 as   58      Executor and 10 more in  his own Right. One Action will not lie against him for the whole Money because  there must be several judgments. And Dana says that soon  after he began Practice he drew a Writ upon a Note taken by an Executor as  Executor for a Debt of his Testator and drew the Writ as if the Note had been  taken in the Executors own private Right. Auchmuty for the Defendant pleaded in Abatement  that the Note was given to Plaintiff as Executor not in his own Right and the  Inferiour Court abated the Writ but he appealed  and at the Superiour Court got Mr.  Reed to speak for him who contended that the Words as Executor were  idle and the Court unanimously set up his Writ.

125,1760-11-14,Another Year is now gone and upon Recollection I find I have executed none  of my Plans of study. I cannot Satisfy my self that I  am much more knowing either from Books or Men from this Chamber or the  World than I was at least a Year ago when I wrote the foregoing Letter to  Sewal. Most of my Time has been spent in Rambling and  Dissipation. Riding and Walking Smoking Pipes and Spending Evenings consume  a vast Proportion of my Time and the Cares and Anxieties of Business damp my  Ardor and scatter my attention. But I must stay more at home -- and commit more  to Writing. A Pen is certainly an excellent Instrument to fix a Mans Attention  and to inflame his Ambition. I am therefore beginning a new literary Year with  the 26th. of my life.   4

Parson  Potters Affair with Mrs. Winchester and other  Women is hardly forgotten. A Minister famous for Learning oratory  orthodoxy Piety and Gravity discovered to have the most debauched and  polluted of Minds to have pursued a series of wanton Intrigues with one Woman  and another to have got his Maid with Child and all that. -- Lately  Deacon Savils Affair has become public.

184,1765-01-24,We accordingly agreed to meet the next Evening in one of Ballards back  Chambers and determine upon Times Places and studies.   2      We  accordingly met the next Evening Mr. Gridley  Fitch and I and spent the whole Evening. Proposals were to  read a Reign and the statutes of that Reign to read Hurds Dialogues and any new Pieces. But at last we  determined to read The Feudal Law and Cicero only least we  should loose sight of our main Object by attending to too many.  Thurdsday Nights were agreed on and to meet first  at Mr. Gridleys office. There we accordingly met on the  Thurdsday Night following and suffered our  Conversation to ramble upon Hurds Dialogues the Pandects their Discovery in  Italy by Lotharius in 1127 in the Reign of  Stephen upon Lambard de priscis Anglorum Legibus in Saxon  and Latin upon Ld.

I was but just getting into my Geers just getting under  Sail and an Embargo is laid upon the Ship. Thirty Years of my Life are passed  in Preparation for Business.

194,1765-12-23,Can any Thing less abominable have prompted you to commence an Enemy to  human Liberty-an Enemy to human Nature-- an Advocate for Courts more  frightful infamous and detestable than the star Chamber and high Commission  for Taxations more grievous arbitrary and unconstitutional than ship Money  on which you and your Hampden were known to ring eternal Changes and indeed  of which you had so much Right to complain. If ever an Infant Country deserved  to be cherished it is  America if ever a People merited Honor   18      and  Happiness they are her Inhabitants. They have the high sentiments of Romans in  the most prosperous and virtuous Times of that Commonwealth: Yet they have the  tenderest feelings of Humanity and the noblest Benevolence of Christians. They  have the most habitual radical sense of Liberty and the highest Reverence for  Virtue. They are descended from a Race which in a Confidence in Providence  set the seas and the skies Monsters and savages Tyrants and Devils  at Defyance for the sake of their Liberty and  Religion. Yet this is the People on whom you are contributing for Hire to  rivit and confirm everlasting Oppression.
195,1765-12-24,Returned from  Boston. Spent the afternoon and Evening at Home.
196,1765-12-25,Mr. S. Adams told me he was glad I was nominated for  several Reasons. -- 1st. Because he hoped that such an Instance of Respect from  the Town of  Boston would make an Impression on my Mind and secure my  Friendship to the Town from Gratitude. 2dly. He was in Hopes such a Distinction  from  Boston would be of Service to my Business and Interest.  3d. He hoped that  Braintree finding the Eyes of  Boston were upon me would fix their's on me too next May. His  Hopes in the two first [  ] Particulars may be well  grounded but I am sure not in the Third.

201,1765-12-30,Now have not they the same Reason to contend against Parliamentary  Taxations which you and your Hampden had against regal and  ministerial Taxations. -- What were your Reasons?
202,1765-12-31,The national Attention is fixed upon the Colonies. The Religion  Administration of Justice Geography Numbers &c. of the Colonies are a  fashionable Study. But what wretched Blunders do they make in attempting to  regulate them. They know not the Character of Americans.   4    
203,1766-01-01,It is said at  N. York that private Letters inform the great Men are  exceedingly irritated at the Tumults in  America and are determined to inforce the Act. This irritable Race however will have  good Luck to inforce it. They will find it a more obstinate War than the  Conquest of  Canada and  Louisiana.   7    
204,1766-01-03,Fair Weather and Snow enough. Major Miller Dr.  Savil and Mr. Joseph Penniman spent the Evening with  me. Agriculture Commerce Fishery Arts Manufactures Town Provincial  American and national Politicks the Subject. --  Anecdote in the Beginning of the Year Deacon Penniman was  for reducing the Salary of the School Master from 330 to 300. The Master  Penniman insisted on keeping half the time in the Middle  Precinct if he had but 300 to which the Select Men agreed. But when the Time  came for Penniman to remove to the School in the Middle  Precinct Moses French who had for many Winters kept the  School there and had been an active Advocate for Deacon  Penniman complained that he had depended on that School and had not  provided any other Business and petitioned to keep it. So that the Deacon was  obliged to [  ] move the select Men to agree afresh with  Penniman and allow him his 330 to keep at the North  End. Thus it seems the Deacon did not see to the End of the Year when he began  it.
205,1766-01-04,Edes & Gill's   9      Gazette  brought in. I find that Somebody has published the very scene in  Shakespears  [Henry] 8 which I have put into  Ld. Clarendons Letter to Pym. This  brings to my Mind again Ld. Bacons Doctrine of secret  invisible Connections and communications and unknown undiscovered Laws of  Nature. Hampden writes to Pym on the Failure  of Justice in  America on the shutting up of the Courts of justice since  October. He has given the Public Mr. Otis's Arguments before  the Governor and Council from Magna Charta Ld. Coke  the Judges Oaths &c. -- and promises to give more.
206,1766-01-05,Heard Mr. Wibird all Day. A Sacramental Sermon on  It is finished. -- 
207,1766-01-06,At Home. Mr. Smith and Mr. Penniman dined  here.
208,1766-01-07,Nothing gave me so much Regret or such Remorse in my whole Life as the  Part I acted in conniving at some of King Charles's  grievous and illegal Measures and the Pains I took to support him and his two  oppressive Instruments Laud and Strafford.  But my very zealous Attachment to the Church and the enthusiastical Spirit of  Party made me see many Objects in a Partial Light. I have condemned  my self for these faults from that Time to this. And  it grieves me to hear that the Barbadians have acted so vile a Part in the  Year 1765. That Island was settled under the Protectorate of  Cromwell by zealous Partisans for Passive Obedience and I  suppose a Remnant of the servile Spirit of their Ancestors and of those  ruinous Doctrines have prevailed on them to submit. I said under the  Protectorate for I must own I can scarcely prevail on my  self to call it an Usurpation or the struggle made by you and  Hampden and others a Rebellion. If I was to revise my  History I should alter many Things which the Rage of Party hurried me to  record and in Particular the Tittle of that  Work.   12    
209,1766-01-08,At Home. Wrote &c.
210,1766-01-09,At Home all day. Mr. Smith Dr. Tufts  Dr. Savil Mr. Bass &c. here.
211,1766-01-10,What will they say in  England when they see the Resolves of the American  Legislatures the Petitions from the united Colonies the Resolutions of the  Merchants in  Boston  N. York  Phyladelphia &c.
212,1766-01-11,The Truth is here is a strange Ambiguity affected in this Matter. Courts  will sit and suffer no Business to be done but adjourn adjourn to next Spring.  So that the Clerks are at a loss whether to make out Writs the People are  uncertain whether such Action will ever be sustained at all and they know  certainly that no Execution can be had till next Spring. So that they think it  not worth while to be at the Expence of   19      purchasing Writs. In this situation of Things we are as much deprived  of the Kings Protection of our Persons and Properties as unable to procure  justice as if an actual Record was made of Invasion or Rebellion. So that the  subject is as effectually deprived of the Benefit and Protection of the Law as  if the Laws were silent drowned in the Din of War! We are therefore in Effect  deprived of the Benefit of Magna Charta.
213,1766-01-12,Heard Mr. Wibird all day at Evening Mr.  Etter here.
214,1766-01-13,Spent the Evening at Mr. Adams's with him and  Brother Swift very socially.
215,1766-01-14,Dined at Mr. William Coopers with  Messrs. Cushing Story and John  Boylstone. Cushing silent and sly as usual. Story I  dont know what. Cooper and Boylstone  principal Talkers. Boylstone affecting a  Phylosophical Indifference about Dress  Furniture Entertainments &c. laughed at the affectation of nicely  distinguishing Tastes such as the several Degrees of Sweet till you come up to  the first degree of bitter laughed at the great Expences for Furniture as Nick  Boylstones Carpetts Tables Chairs  Glasses Beds &c. which Cooper said were the richest in  N. America. -- The highest Taste and newest Fashion would soon  flatten and grow old. -- A Curse or two upon the Climate preferable however to  Carolina. But every Part of  Europe preferable to this. -- [Query]. Is not  this Nicety of Feeling this Indisposition to be satisfyed with the Climate of the same Nature with the  Delicacy of Tastes and the Curiosity about Furniture just before exploded. --  Spent the Evening at Cunninghams.
216,1766-01-15,I was invited by Crafts and Trott to go  and spend an Evening with them and some others Avery was  mentioned to me as one. I went and was very civilly and respectfully treated  by all Present. We had Punch Wine Pipes and Tobacco Bisquit and Cheese -- &c. I heard nothing but such  Conversation as passes at all Clubbs among Gentlemen  about the Times. No Plotts no Machinations. They  Chose a Committee to make Preparations for grand Rejoicings upon the Arrival of  the News of a Repeal of the Stamp Act and I heard afterwards they are to have  such Illuminations Bonfires Piramids Obelisks  such grand Exhibitions and such Fireworks as were never before seen in  America. -- I wish they mayn't be  disappointed.
217,1766-01-16,Spent the Evening at Bracketts with Gen. Winslow Coll. Bradford Mr. Otis  Father Danforth Coll.  Richmond Mr. [Brinlys?] and  Mr. [Caldwell?] and Captain  Hayward. Mr. Otis gave Us some Account of  Ruggles's Behaviour at the Congress and Winslow  told Us about catching Bass with Eeel Spears at  the North River. Otis says that when they came  to sign Ruggles moved that none of them  should sign but that the Petitions should be carried back to the assemblies  to see if they would adopt them. This would have defeated the whole  Enterprize. This Ruggles has an inflexible Oddity about him  which has gained him a Character for Courage and Probity but renders him a  disagreable Companion in Business.
218,1766-01-17,Came home and dined and there stayed.
219,1766-01-18,What a Satisfaction is [it] to reflect Mr.  Pym (I hope the infernal Regions have not made you forget all your  humanity) that I can lye under the Imputation of no  Guilt be subject to no Punishment lose none of my Property or the  Pleasures and Necessaries Conveniences or Ornaments of Life which  indulgent Providence has showered around me but by the judgment of my Peers  my equals my Neighbours Men who know me and to  whom I am known Men who have no End to serve by Punishing me Men who wish to   31      find me innocent if charged with a Crime and Men who are  indifferent on which Side the Truth lies if I dispute with my  Neighbour.

224,1766-03-03,Mark the Fruits of this Election to me. Will the Church People be angry  and grow hot and furious? Or will they be cooler and calmer for it? Will  Thayers other Precinct friends resent  it and become more violent or will they be less so? -- In short I cannot  answer these Questions. Many of them will be disheartened I know. Some will be  glad.
225,1766-03-10,It will increase my Connections with the People.
226,1766-03-11,Cushing Spoke out boldly and said he was  ready to go on. He had no Difficulty about going on.  Lynde said We are here.  Oliver said here am I in Duress and if I  must go on I must.

230,1766-03-15,The Snow is as deep and in as mountainous Banks as it has been at any Time  this Winter. -- The unanimous Agreement of the Court and Bar was to try a few  civil Causes one at least and then adjourn over.
231,1766-03-16,Heard Mr. Wibirt all day.
232,1766-03-17,Went to Town Meeting thro a fierce Wind a  soaking Rain and miry Snowy Travelling Roads and Banks of Snow.
233,1766-03-18,Went to  Weymouth found the Family mourning the Loss and preparing for  the Funeral of old Tom. -- After my Return rode to  Mr. Halls and in my Return stopped at Mr.  Basses Jo. Basses for the Papers.  Major Miller soon afterwards came in  and he and I looked on each other without Wrath or shame or Guilt at least  without any great Degree of Either 'tho I must own  I did not feel exactly as I used to in his Company and I am sure by his Face  and Eyes that he did not in mine. We were very Social &c.
234,1766-03-19,At Home.
235,1766-03-20,At Mrs. Baxters Funeral.
236,1766-03-21,A fine Spring like Morning. The Birds of many Sorts as sprightly and  musical.
237,1766-03-28,What shall we think of Mr. Pitt? What shall we call him?  The Genius and Guardian Angell of  Britain and British  America? Or what? Is it possible that  Greenville offensive to his K [King] dissagreable to the People should prevail  vs. the whole new Ministry and Mr.  Pitt?
238,1766-04-10,At  Plymouth. Court open and Business proceeding.
239,1766-04-15,Colonists by Charters shall have same Priviledges as if born in  England i.e. that  England shall be reputed their natale solum.  Massachusetts by Fiction supposed to lye  in  England. -- Q. whether this Thought was not suggested by the  [Braintree] Instructions?  a fiction of Law insensible in Theory and injurious in  Practice? All  England is represented then [  ]  Massachusetts is.   10    
240,1766-04-26,Foresight Judgment Sagacity Penetration &c. are but very feeble  infirm Things in these great affairs of State and War. What  Hutchinson  [said] in the Probate office was as good a Way as any -- I  never was more at a loss in my Life about any  Thing future! What the new Ministry will do I know not. If Mr.  Pitt was in I should be at no loss at all. -- In this Way an Air of  deep important Wisdom is preserved without danger of being proved mistaken by  time.
241,1766-04-27,In the Evening I had a great deal of Conversation with Ezekiel  Price Yesterday about Politicks &c. I provoked him to speak freely by  calling him an Hutchinsonian. -- I swear says he I think the Lieutenant  Governor an honest Man and I think he has been most damnably abused and  slandered and bely'd &c. I know all his violent  Opposers -- I know them and what they are after and their disciples in and  about the Capital. There is no Man in the Province would fill any one of his  offices as he does. He is the best judge of Probate &c.Flings about  Otis and Adams and about being one of their  Disciples &c.
242,1766-04-28,At Home.
243,1766-04-29,Thus  America will ring with Riots Resolves opening Courts  Instructions Edes  Gills Gazette -- Writers &c. All the Evil will be laid  upon them -- and the Congress too and recalling Orders for Goods.
244,1766-05-04,Returning from Meeting this Morning I saw for the first Time a likely young  Button Wood Tree lately planted on the Triangle made by the Three Roads by  the House of Mr. James Brackett. The Tree is well set well  guarded and has on it an Inscription The Tree of Liberty and  cursed is he who cutts this Tree.-- Q. What  will be the Consequences of this Thought? I never heard an Hint of it till I  saw it but I hear that some Persons grumble and threaten to girdle it.   14    
245,1766-05-18,Mem. to write some Speculations upon the Union of Legislative and Executive  Powers -- and upon the Knot the junto the Combination.
246,1766-05-26,A duller Day than last Monday when the Province was in a Rapture for the  Repeal of the Stamp Act I do not remember to have passed.  My Wife who had long  depended on going to  Boston and my little  Babe [  ] were both very ill of an  hooping Cough. My self  under Obligation to attend the Superiour Court at  Plymouth the next day and therefore unable to go to  Boston. And the  Town of Braintree insensible to the Common Joy!   15    
247,1766-05-28,This Morning [Samuel] Adams  was chosen Clerk and Otis Speaker.  Govr. Bernard negatived him. Cushing was  chosen. In the Afternoon they proceeded to choose Councillors when  Hutchinson and the two  Olivers were dropp'd and  Trowbridge was dropped and Mr. Pitts  Coll. Gerrish Coll. White Bowers  Powel and Mr. Saunders and  Dexter were chosen. -- What a Change! This Day seems to be  the litteral Accomplishment of a Prophecy of  Mr. Otis published two or three Winters ago in the  News Paper  The Day is hastening on with large Strides when a dirty very  dirty witless Rabble I mean the great Vulgar shall go down with deserved  Infamy to all Posterity. Thus the Triumph of Otis and his  Party are compleat. But what changes are yet to  come? Will not the other Party soon be uppermost?
248,1766-05-29,He said further that for himself he felt so happily after his Death that  he was pretty sure he had behaved well during his Lifetime. For himself he was  easy but the poor Secretary is infirm it will bear hard upon him. And for the  Lieutenant Governor now the Act is repeal'd and  considering how he has been used instead of doing any  Thing to make up his Loss to leave him out of Council and so to  confirm in the Minds of the People a suspicion that he has been an Enemy to the  Country is very hard for a Man who has behaved so well as he has
249,1766-06-20,But I observe the Devise and Legacy is to him if living. It has never yet  been proved probably never will be that he was then dead but admitting it  certain he was not then living would it follow that the Residuary Clause  comprehended and extended to John what was before given conditionally to  Francis.
250,1766-07-21,Pym's Speech after the Articles vs. Sir George Ratcliffe were  read.   19    
251,1766-07-24,Thanksgiving for the Repeal of the Stamp - Act. Mr. Smiths  Text was  The Lord reigneth let the Earth rejoice and the Multitude of the Isles be  glad thereof. Mr. Wibirts was Genesis 50th. 20th. --  But as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to  bring to pass as it is this Day to save much People alive. --  America is Joseph the King Lords and Commons  -- Josephs Father and Brothers. Our Forefathers sold into  Egypt i.e. Persecuted into  America &c. Wibirt shone they say.
252,1766-07-28,Gridley  Otis and Auchmuty were the chief Speakers.  Gridley however was not in  Trim. I never saw him more out of Spirits. Otis told some  Stories Auchmuty told more and Scolded and  rail'd about the lowness of the Fees. This is  Auchmutys common Place Topick -- In  Jamaica  Barbadoes  South Carolina and  N. York a Lawyer will make an Independent Fortune in Ten  Years.
253,1766-07-29,To have this Man represented as the first at the Bar is a Libel upon it -- a  Reproach and disgrace to it.   21    
254,1766-07-30,At  Boston. The Weather cloudy. Going to the Common Pleas  to day. Let me take Minutes. Let me remark the  Speakers their Action their Pronunciation there Learning their Reasoning  their Art and skill. Let me remark the Causes the remarkable Circumstances  c. and report  [ sentence unfinished ]
255,1766-08-05,Satt out with  my Wife for  Salem -- dined at  Boston -- drank Tea at Dr. Simons  Tufts's at  Medford -- lodg'd at Mr.  Bishops.
256,1766-08-06,Satt out from Mr. Bishops oated at  Norwoods alias Martins and reached  Brother Cranches at 12 o Clock  dined and drank Tea and then rode down to the Neck Gate and then back  thro the common and down to  Beverly Ferry then back thro the  common and round the back Part of the Town Home. Then Walked round the other  Side of the Town to Coll. Browns  who not being at Home we returned. The Town is situated on a Plain a Level a  Flat -- scarce an Eminence can be found any where  to take a View. The Streets are broad and strait  and pretty clean. The Houses are the most elegant and grand that I have seen  in any of the maritime Towns.
257,1766-08-07,In the Morning rode a single Horse in Company with  Mrs. Cranch and  Mrs. Adams in a Chaise to  Marblehead. [  ] The Road   22      from  Salem to  Marblehead 4 miles is pleasant indeed. The Grass  Plotts and Fields are delightfull. But  Marblehead differs from  Salem. The Streets are narrow and rugged and dirty -- but there  are some very grand Buildings. Returned and din'd at  Cranch's -- after dinner walked to  Witchcraft Hill -- An Hill about 1/2 Mile from  Cranches where the famous Persons formerly executed for  Witches were buried. Somebody within a few Years has planted a Number of Locust  Trees over the Graves as a Memorial of that memorable Victory over the Prince  of the Power of the Air. This Hill is in a large Common belonging to the  Proprietors of  Salem &c. From it you have a fair View of the Town of the  River the North and South Fields -- of  Marble Head -- of Judge Lynde's Pleasure House  and of  Salem Village &c.
258,1766-08-18,Went to  Taunton. Lodged at McWhorters.  [  ]
259,1766-08-19,Dined at Captn. Cobbs with  Coll. G. Leonard  Paine Leonard young Cobb  c.
260,1766-08-20,Spent Evening at Lodgings with Charles Cushing and  Daniel Oliver of  Middleborough Paine and  Leonard -- socially.
261,1766-08-21,Fine Weather -- feel well.   23    
262,1766-11-03,Sett off with  my Wife for  Salem. Stopped 1/2 Hour att  Boston cross'd the Ferry and at 3 O  Clock arrived at Hill's the Tavern in  Malden the Sign of the rising Eagle at the Brook near  Mr. Emmersons [Emerson's] Meeting House 5  Miles from Norwoods where vizt. at Hills we  dined. Here we fell in Company with Kent and  Sewal. We all oated at Martins where we  found the new Sherriff of  Essex Coll.  Saltonstal. We all rode into Town together. Arrived at my dear Brother  Cranches about 8 and drank Tea  and are all very happy. Sat and heard the Ladies talk about Ribbon Catgut and  Paris net Riding hoods Cloth Silk and Lace. -- Brother  Cranch came Home and a very  happy Evening we had. Cranch is  now in a good Situation for Business near the Court House and Mr.  Bernards [Barnard's] Meeting house and on the Road  to  Marblehead -- his House fronting the Wharffs the Harbour and  Shipping has a fine Prospect before it.
263,1766-11-04,At this Court I also saw a young Gentleman lately sworn in the  Inferiour Court whose Name is Samuel  Porter he lived with Mr. Farnham took his  2d. Degree last Year and lives at  Ipswich. Thus every County of the Province Swarms with Pupils  and students and young Practicers of Law.
264,1766-11-05,Spent the Evening at Mr. Pynchons with  Farnham Sewal  Sergeant Coll. Saltonstall &c. very  agreably. Punch Wine bread and Cheese Apples  Pipes and Tobacco. Popes and Bonfires this Evening at  Salem and a Swarm of tumultuous People attending them.
265,1766-11-06,Drank Tea at Mrs. Kneelands. Got Home before 8 o Clock.
266,1766-11-07,Afternoon went to Major Crosbeys to see him execute a  Codicil to his Will. The old Gentleman is very desirous that the Province  should comply with the [King's] Recommendation to make up  the Damages to the sufferers.   27    
267,1766-11-08,This Morning I asked John Clark some Questions about it.  He thinks if the King has requested it it will be difficult to refuse it but  yet it will be hard upon us to pay it.
268,1766-11-09,Fine Weather Yet. Heard Mr. Penniman all Day. Spent Evening  with Dr. Savil.
269,1766-11-10,Rain. Kill'd Cow. Read chiefly in the American  Gazeteers which are a very valuable Magazine of american Knowledge.   28    
270,1766-11-11,After all this which was born without a Murmur does it not exceed all  Credibility that this same Governor should meet the two Houses and open the  Session with a Speech -- a Speech! -- a Speech! I want Words to express my  Sentiments of this Speech!   31    
271,1766-12-08,Nat Clap. These Town Meeting Laws are the most awful  Things and the  Town of Boston ought to be stigmatized for setting the  Example.   32    
272,1766-12-23,But what will be the Consequences of this Deputation? -- and what were the  Causes of it? My Brothers Disregard and neglect of the office and his Neglect  to pay Greenleaf were the Causes.
273,1766-12-24,Thus I believe that it appears to all who consider the Matter that almost  all the People whether better or worse are of one Mind about the Governor and  absolutely hate him and despize him -- let  Phylanthrop say what he will. And indeed I have very good Reasons to think that  Phylanthrop lyed when he said that the better sort had  taken no Offence and absolutely endeavoured to  impose a palpable falshood upon the Public.   39    
274,1766-12-31,This Soliloquy satisfy'd me! The whole Mystery  was unriddled -- all Phylanthrops facts Anecdotes Reasonings  Vapourings all that he has said done or wrote or  can say do or write is answered at once. There is no further occasion for  scribling &c. nor for me to write any Thing  more but the Name of [  ] Misanthrop.
275,1766-12-32,Copy of his Petition last June was 12 months for a salary as Lieutenant  Governor. It is in the Journal sent down together with a Message from the  Governor 12 day of June A.D. 1765 Wednesday. Considered Fryday June 14. 1765 10 O clock.   44    
276,1767-03-01,When I was in that Chamber of Distress I   45      felt the Meltings of  Commiseration. This Office of Overseer of the Poor leads a Man into scenes of  [  ] Distress and is a continual Exercise of the  benevolent Principles in his Mind. His Compassion is constantly excited and  his Benevolence encreased.  s 46 - 56  [ s -- no s available ]  End-paper  [  --  ]  End-paper  [  --  ]  End-paper  [  --  ]  End-paper  [  --  ]    [  --  ]    [  -- ]

Rode next day baited at  Ellis's dined at Newcombs and proceeded to  Barnstable lodged at Howes's and feel myself  much better than I did when I came from Home. But I have had a very wet cold  dirty disagreable journey of it. -- Now I am on  the stage and the scene is soon to open what Part shall I act? -- The People  of the County I find are of opinion that Cotton will  worry Nye. But Nye must come off with flying Colours.   5    
278,1767-05-17,Spent the Evening at Mr. Hoveys with Deacon  Foster and Dr. Thomas. The  Deacon was very silent. The  Dr. pretty sociable.
279,1767-05-18,Cushing at  Barnstable said to me -- happy is he whom other Mer Errors  render wise. -- Otis by getting into the general Court has  lost his Business. -- Felix quem faciunt aliena Pericula cautum -- other Mens  Dangers Errors Miscarriages Mistakes Misfortunes.   9  [  --  ]  s 10 -32  [ s -- no s available ]  [ s 16-32 have not been cut. ]    [  -- ]    [  -- ]
280,1768-01-30,I am certain however that the Course I pursue will neither lead me to Fame  Fortune Power   2      Nor to the Service of my Friends Clients or  Country. What Plan of Study Reading or Reflection or Business can  be pursued by a Man who is now at  Pownalborough then at  Marthas Vineyard next at  Boston then at  Taunton presently at  Barnstable then at [  ]  [  ]  Concord now at  Salem then at  Cambridge and afterwards at  Worcester. Now at Sessions then at Pleas now in Admiralty now  at Superiour Court then in the Gallery of the  House. What a Dissipation must this be? Is it possible to pursue a regular  Train of Thinking in this desultory Life? -- By no Means. -- It is a Life of  Here and every where to use the Expression that  is applyed to Othello by  Desdemona's Father. Here and there and every where a rambling roving vagrant vagabond  Life. A wandering Life. At Meins Book  store at Bowes's Shop at Danas  House at Fitches Otis's office and the  Clerks office in the Court Chamber in the Gallery at my own Fire I am  thinking on the same Plan.   3  [  --  ]   4  [  --  ]   5    
281,1769-08-10,What shall I do with 2 Clerks at a Time? And what will the Bar and the  World say? As to the last I am little solicitous but my own Honour Reputation and Conscience are concerned in doing my  best for their Education and Advancement in the World. For their Advancement I  can do little for their Education much if I am not wanting to myself and  them.
282,1769-08-11,Spent the Evening at Mr. Wm. Coopers the Dr. came in and  was very social. He came from a Meeting of the Overseers of the  Colledge at  Cambridge which was called to advise the Corporation to proceed  to the Choice of a President.   6    
283,1769-08-12,Dined at Mr. Isaac Smiths and in the Evening went to  Braintree.
284,1769-08-13,This Mr. Fisk and his Sister Madam Marsh  the former born in the very Month of the Revolution under Sir Edmund  Andros and the latter 10 Years before that made a very venerable  Appearance.
285,1769-08-14,Jealousies arise from little Causes and many might suspect that I was not  hearty in the Cause if I had been absent whereas none of them are more  sincere and stedfast than I am.
286,1769-08-15,Rode to  Taunton 16 miles before 9 O Clock tho I stopped and breakfasted at Haywards  in  Easton 9 miles from  Taunton. Spent all the Leisure moments I could snatch in Reading  a Debate in Parliament in 1744 upon a Motion to inquire into the Conduct of  Admiral Mathews and Vice Admiral Lestock in  the Mediterranean when they had and neglected so fine an  Opportunity of destroying the combined Fleets of  France and  Spain off  Toulon.   9    
287,1769-09-02,Dined at Mr. Smiths. Heard that Messrs.  Otis and Adams went Yesterday to Concert Hall and there had  each of them a Conference with each of the Commissioners and that all the  Commissioners met Mr. Otis this Morning at 6 O Clock at the  British Coffee House. The Cause and End of these Conferences are Subjects of  much Speculation in Town.
288,1769-09-03,Heard Dr. Cooper in the forenoon Mr.  Champion of  Connecticutt in the Afternoon and Mr. Pemberton  in the Evening at the Charity Lecture. Spent the Remainder of the Evening and  supped with Mr. Otis in Company with Mr.  Adams Mr. Wm. Davis and Mr. Jno.  Gill. The Evening spent in preparing for the Next Days Newspaper - a  curious Employment. Cooking up Paragraphs Articles Occurences &c. --  working the political Engine! Otis talks all. He grows the  most talkative Man alive. No other Gentleman in Company can find a Space to put  in a Word -- as Dr. Swift expressed it he leaves no Elbow  Room. There is much Sense Knowledge and Spirit and  Humour in his Conversation. But he grows narrative  like an old Man. Abounds with Stories.
289,1769-09-04,Spent the Evening at Dr. Peckers with the Clubb. Mr. Otis introduced a Stranger a  Gentleman from  Georgia recommended to him by the late Speaker of the House in  that Province. Otis indulged himself   10      in all his  Airs. Attacked the Aldermen Inches and  Pemberton for not calling a Town meeting to consider the  Letters of the Governor General Commodore Commissioners Collector  Comptroller &c.charged them with Timidity Haughtiness Arbitrary  Dispositions and Insolence of Office. But not the least Attention did he  shew to his Friend the Georgian. -- No Questions  concerning his Province their Measures against the Revenue Acts their Growth  Manufactures Husbandry Commerce -- No general Conversation concerning the  Continental Opposition - Nothing but one continued Scene of bullying  bantering reproaching and ridiculing the Select Men. -- Airs and  Vapours about his Moderatorship and Membership and  Cushings Speakership. -- There is no Politeness nor Delicacy  no Learning nor Ingenuity no Taste or Sense in this Kind of Conversation.
290,1769-09-06,Mr. Cudworth told me on the Town house Steps that  Mr. Charles Paxton the Commissioner told him this day that  it was possible he might be sent with some Proscess  on board a Man of War and he advised him as a friend not to attempt to take  any Man from on Board the Man of War for you have no Right to and if you  attempt it you'l never come away alive -- and I want  to see Otis the [Deputy] Sherriff to give  him the same Advice.   11      -- Cudworth told this to  Otis in my Hearing and Otis went directly to  Mr. Paxtons as I since hear and Mr. Paxton  gave him the same Advice.
291,1769-10-19,The morning at Bracketts upon the Case of the Whale. The  afternoon at the office posting Books.   12    
292,1769-10-24,Dined with my Friend and Uncle Mr.  Quincy and returned after Meeting to  Boston.   13    
293,1769-11-01,I dont think the World can furnish a more curious Collection of Characters  than those that made up this Company -- Otis  Kent Dana Gridley  Fitch Winthrop &c.   18    
294,1769-12-23,The great Question The great Questions concerning the Right of  Juries in the Colonies by upon a Comparison of the 3 Statutes and  concerning the Right of impressing Seamen for his Majestys Service whether  with or without Warrants from the Lords of the Admiralty upon orders of  the [King] in Council are very important. And as they  the [  ] of Such a Pamphlet might suggest alterations  in the Statutes and might possibly procure us for the future the Benefit of  juries in such Cases. And the World ought to know at least the American part  of it more than it does of the true foundation of Impresses if they have  any.   19    
295,1770-01-16,In short I never saw such an Object of Admiration Reverence Contempt and  Compassion all at once as this. I fear I tremble I mourn for the Man and for  his Country. Many others mourne over him with Tears in their Eyes.   20    
296,1770-02-26,At Clubb this Evening Mr. Scott  and Mr. Cushing gave us a most alarming Account of  O [Otis]. He has been this afternoon raving  Madraving vs. Father Wife Brother Sister Friend  c.   24    
297,1770-06-19,Rambled with Kent round Landlord  Treadwells Pastures to see how our Horses fared. We found them in  [  ] Grass up to their Eyes. Excellent Pastures. This  Hill on which stand the Meeting House and Court House is a fine Elevation and  We have here a fine Air and the pleasant Prospect of the winding River at the  foot of the Hill.   25    
298,1770-06-25,This Observation was echoed from some Tory who applyed it to a late  Quotation of the House of Representatives. It is true Richard  2d. and H. 6. were  weak and worthless Princes and their Parliaments were bold and resolute but  weak Princes may arise hereafter and then there will be need of daring and  determined Parliaments. The Reigns of R. 2. and  H. 6 were the Reigns of Evil Councillors and  Favourites and they exhibit notable Examples of  the public Mischiefs arising from such Administrations and of national and  parliamentary Vengeance on such wicked Minions.
299,1770-06-26,Stephens the  Connecticutt Hemp Man was at my Office with Mr.  Counsellor Powell and Mr. Kent.  Stephens says that the whole  Colony of Connecticutt has given more implicit Observance to a  Letter from the Select Men of  Boston than to their Bibles for some Years. And that in  Consequence of it the Country is vastly happier than it was for every Family  has become a little manufactory House and they raise and make within  themselves many Things for which they used to run in debt to the Merchants  and Traders. So that No Body is hurt but  Boston and the Maritime Towns. -- I wish there was a Tax of 5s.  st. on every Button from  England. It would be vastly for the good of this Country  c. As to all the Bustle and Bombast about Tea it has been begun by about  1/2 doz.  Hollands Tea Smugglers who could not find so much Profit in  their Trade since the Nine Pence was taken off in  England. -- Thus He. Some Sense and some Nonsense!   26    
300,1770-06-27,Took an Airing in the Chaise with my Brother Sam. Adams  who returned and dined with me. He says he never looked forward in his Life  never planned laid a scheme or formed a design of laying up  any Thing for himself or others after him. I told  him I could not say that of myself if that had been true of me you would  never have seen my Face -- and I think this was true. I was necessitated to  ponder in my Youth to consider of Ways and Means of raising a Subsistence  food and Rayment and Books and Money to pay for my Education to the Bar. So  that I must have sunk into total Contempt and Obscurity if not perished for  Want if I had not planned for futurity. And it is no Damage to a young Man to  learn the Art of living early if it is at the Expence of much musing and pondering and Anxiety.
301,1770-06-28,This afternoon Mr. Wm. Frobisher gave me a Narration of his  Services to the Province in introducing the Manufacture of Pot ashes and Pearl  ashes and of his unsuccessfull  Petitions   28      to the General Court for a Compensation. He says he has  suffered in his fortune by his Labours and  Expences and has been instrumental of introducing  and establishing the Manufacture And can obtain nothing. That 25000 st. worth  of [  ] Potashes have been exported from this Town yearly  for 5 Years past and more than that Quantity for the last two Years as appears  by the Custom House Books and Mr. Sheaff the Collector was  his Informer. That He has invented a Method of making Potashes in much greater  Quantity and better Quality than heretofore has been done from the same  materials without any Augmentation of Expence. That  he went to  Hingham and worked with Mr. Lincoln a month  and has a Certificate from him [  ] to the foregoing  Purpose. That his new Method seperates from the  Potash a neutral Salt that is very pure and of valuable Use in medicine  c. and that if his Method was adopted no Russian Potash would sell at any  Markett where American was to be had. -- Thus  Projectors ever restless.
302,1770-06-29,Oated my Horse and drank baume Tea at Treadwells in  Ipswich where I found Brother Porter and  chatted with him 1/2 Hour then rode to  Rowley and lodged at Captn.  Jewitts. -- Jewitt had rather the House should sit  all the Year round than give up an Atom of Right or Priviledge. -- The Governor cant frighten the People  with &c.
303,1770-06-30,By accidentally taking this new rout I have avoided  Portsmouth and my old Friend the  Governor of it. But I must make my Compliments to him as I return.  It is a Duty. He is my Friend And I am his. I should have seen enough of the  Pomps and Vanities and Ceremonies of that little World  Portsmouth If I had gone there but Formalities and Ceremonies  are an abomination in my sight. I hate them in Religion Government Science  Life.
304,1770-07-01,He gives a sad Account of the Opposition and Persecution he has suffered  from the Tories for his Zeal and Firmness against their Schemes. Says they  i.e. the Moultons Sewalls and  Lymans contrived every Way to thwart vex and distress him  and have got 1000 st [sterling] from him at least but he  says that Providence has seemed to frown upon them one running distracted and  another &c. and has favoured him in Ways that  he did not foresee.
305,1770-07-02,Got into my Chair after my Return from the old Woman rode with  Elder Bradbury thro Sir  William Pepperells Woods stopped and oated at  Millikins and rode into  Falmouth and putt up at Mr.  Jonathan Webbs -- Where I found my Classmate Charles  Cushing Mr. George Lyde the Collector here one  Mr. Johnson and one Mr. Crocker.   34    
306,1770-07-03,Rose in comfortable Health.
307,1770-07-08,This Week has been taken up in the Hurry of the Court and I have not been  able to snatch a Moment to put down any Thing. The  softly People where I lodge Don Webb and his Wife are the  Opposites of every Thing great spirited and  enterprizing. His father was a dissenting  Parson and a Relation of mine a zealous Puritan and famous Preacher. This  son however without the least Regard to his Education his Connections  Relations Reputation or Examination into the controversy turns about and goes  to Church merely because an handfull of young foolish fellows here took it  into their Heads to go. Don never was or aimed to be any  Thing at Colledge but a silent Hearer of a few  Rakes and he continues to this day the same Man rather the same softly living  Thing that creepeth upon the face of the Earth. He attempted Trade but failed  in that -- now keeps School and takes Boarders and his Wife longs to be  genteel to go to Dances Assemblies Dinners suppers &c. -- but cannot  make it out for Want thereof. Such Imbicility of Genius such Poverty of  Spirit such Impotence of Nerve is often accompanied with a  fribbling Affectation of Politeness which is to me completely  ridiculous -- green Tea if We could but get it -- Madeira Wine if I could but  get it -- Collectors genteel Company Dances late suppers and  Clubbs &c. &c.   35    
308,1770-07-12,Thus far I humoured his Impertinence. Well now says he do you want to know  my Name? Yes. My Name is Robert Jordan I belong to C  ape Elizabeth and am now going round there. My forefathers came  over here and settled a great many Years ago. -- After a good deal more of this  harmless Impertinence he turned off and left me. -- I baited at  Millikins and rode thro Saco  Woods and then rode from  Saco Bridge thro the Woods to  Pattens after Night-many sharp steep Hills many Rocks many  deep Rutts and not a Footstep of Man except in the  Road. It was vastly disagreable. Lodged at  Pattens.
309,1770-07-13,Stopped two Hours at Mr. Hemenways and then rode  thro the Woods in excessive Heat to  York dined at Woodbridges who was much elated  with his new Licence and after Dinner was treating  his friends some of them. Spent an Hour at Mr. Sewalls with  Elder Bradbury and then went to  Portsmouth crossed the Ferry after 9 O Clock and  putt up at Tiltons the Sign of the  Marquis of Rockingham -- a very good House. I will call no more at  Stavers's. I found very good Entertainment and excellent  Attendance -- a very convenient House a spacious Yard good stables and an  excellent Garden full of Carrotts Beets Cabbages  Onions Colliflowers &c. This  Tiltons is just behind the State House.
310,1770-07-14,I fully intended to have made a long Visit to Governor  Wentworth upon this Occasion. But he was unluckily gone to  Wolfborough so that this Opportunity is lost.   37    
311,1770-08-09,Pray excuse this the Trouble of this Letter and believe me with  great Esteem and Admiration your most obedient and very huml. servant.
312,1770-08-19,Mr. Mason led us a jaunt over sharp Rocks to the Point of  the Island opposite to  Nantasket where in an hideous Cavern formed by a great  Prominent Rock he shewed Us the Animal Plant or  flower   42      a small spungy muscular  Substance growing fast to the Rock in figure and feeling resembling a young  Girls Breast shooting out at the Top of it a flower  which shrinks in and disappears upon touching the Substance.
313,1770-08-20,Yet even this must be understood with certain Limitations for there are  Times when the Cause of Religion of Government of Liberty the Interest of  the present Age and of Posterity render it a necessary Duty for a Man to make  known his Sentiments and Intentions boldly and publickly. So that it is difficult to establish any  certain Rule to determine what Things a Man may and what he may not lawfully  conceal and when. But it is no doubt clear that there are many Things which  may lawfully be concealed from many Persons at certain Times and on the other  Hand there are Things which at certain Times it becomes mean and selfish  base and wicked to conceal from some Persons.   44    
314,1770-08-22,These Gentlemen are all Valetudinarians and are taking the Northern Tour for  their Health.   46    
315,1770-08-23,The Consequence of this will be that the Iron Rod of Power will be stretched  out vs. the poor People in every  [ sentence unfinished ]   48  [  -- ]    [ ]    [ ]
316,1771-01-10,When the Co. [Company] 1st. came in they began to banter  Blair Townsend upon his approaching Marriage which it seems  is to be this Evening to one Mrs. Brimmer.  [  ] Treasurer punned upon the Name. (N.B.  Shenstone thanked God that his Name was obnoxious to no Pun).  And We had frequent Allusions Squints and Fleers about entering in &c.  among the Merchants and Widowers and Bachelors &c.   3    
317,1771-02-08,Such a Plan may be of greater Extent and Duration than at first We may  imagine. It might be usefull at any Time. There are  in this Prov. [Province] natural Productions  eno. Hemp Silk and many other Commodities might be  introduced here and cultivated for Exportation. The Mulberry Tree succeeds as  well in our Climate and Soil as in any.
318,1771-02-14,Dined at Mr. Hancocks with the Members  Warren Church Cooper  c. and Mr. Harrison and spent the whole Afternoon and  drank Green Tea from  Holland I hope but dont know.
319,1771-02-15,Came home and can now answer the Question. I learned nothing. The Company  was agreable enough. -- Came home in great Anxiety  and distress and had a most unhappy Night -- never in more misery in my whole  Life -- God grant I may never see such another Night.   10    
320,1771-02-16,Have had a pensive day.   11    
321,1771-04-16,Yesterday I rode to Town from  Braintree before 9 attended my Office till near two then dined  and went over the ferry to  Cambridge attended the House the whole Afternoon returned and  spent the whole Evening in my Office alone -- and I spent the Time much more  profitably as well as pleasantly than I should have done at Clubb. This Evening is spending the same Way. In the Evening  I can be alone at my Office and no where else. I never could in my family.
322,1771-04-18,Tuesday I staid at my Office in Town Yesterday  went up to  Cambridge. Returned at Night to  Boston and to  Braintree still calm happy  Braintree -- at 9. o Clock at night. This Morning cast my Eyes  out to see what my Workmen had done in my Absence and rode with  my Wife over to  Weymouth. There we are to hear young Blake -- a  pretty fellow.   3    
323,1771-04-20,This mettlesome Barrister gives us the best Account of the Unanimity of the  Kings Bench that I have ever heard or read.  According to him it is not uncommon abilities [  ]  Integrity and Temper as Mr. Burrows would perswade us but sheer fear of Lord M-d  [Mansfield] the Scottish Chief which produces   4      this Miracle in the moral and intellectual World -- i.e. of 4  Judges agreeing perfectly in every Rule order and judgment for 74 Years  together. 4 Men never agreed so perfectly in Sentiment for so long a Time  before. 4 Clocks never struck together a thousandth Part of the Time 4 Minds  never thought reasoned and judged alike before for a ten thousandth  Part.
324,1771-04-21,Last night went up to  Braintree and this Evening down to  Boston call'd at S. Adams's and found Mr. Otis  Coll. [Colonel] Warren  and Dr. Warren. Otis as Steady and Social  and sober as ever and more so.
325,1771-04-22,In the Morning mounted for  Worcester with Pierpoint Caleb and Rob.  Davis Josa. Quincy &c.  Baited the Horses at Brewers and at Coll.  [Colonel] Buckminsters.
326,1771-04-25,However the jury gave none. They could not Agree. 8 were for Defendants 4  for Plaintiff.   6    
327,1771-05-01,This Evening at the Bar Meeting I asked and obtained the unanimous Consent  of the Bar to take Mr. Elisha Thayer of  Braintree Son of Captn. Ebenr. Thayer Jur. as a Clerk. How few  Years are gone since this Gentleman was pleased to call me a petty  Lawyer at Majr. Crosbys Court. Now  [he] is soliciting me to take his Son and complementing  c.   7      May 2. 1771  me  with being the first Lawyer in the Province as he did in express Words  tho it was but a Compliment and if sincere in him  was not true but a gross Mistake nay what is more remarkable still  complimenting me with his Seat in the House of Representatives as he did by  assuring me in Words that if I had an Inclination to come from  Braintree he would not stand in my Way. -- Such are the  Mistakes we are apt to make in the Characters of Men and in our Conjectures of  their future Fortune. This however is a wretched Tryumph a poor Victory a small Antagonist to defeat --  And I have very few of this Kind of Conquests to boast of. The Governor tells  of a vast No. of these Changes in Sentiment  concerning him -- and will be able to tell of many more.
328,1771-05-02,These are the Insults that I have exposed myself to by a very small and  feeble Exertion for S. Adams to be Register of Deeds. Thus are  the Friends of the People after such dangerous Efforts and such successful  ones too left in the Lurch even by the People themselves. I have acted my  sentiments with the Utmost Frankness at Hazard of all and the certain Loss  of ten times more than it is in the Power of the People to give me for the  sake of the People and now I reap nothing but Insult Ridicule and Contempt  for it even from many of the People themselves. However I have not hitherto  regarded Consequences to myself. I have very chearfully sacrificed my Interest and my Health and  Ease and Pleasure in the service of the People. I have stood by their friends  longer than they would stand by them. I have stood by the People much longer  than they would stand by themselves. But I have learn'd Wisdom by Experience. I shall certainly become  more retired and cautious. I shall certainly mind my own Farm and my own  Office.   9    
329,1771-05-03,He is a singular Man. It will be amusing to observe his Behaviour upon his Return to active Life in the Senate  and at the Bar and the Influence of his Presence upon the public Councils of  this Province. I was an Hour with him this Morning at his Office and there he  was off his Guard and Reserve with me. I find his Sentiments are not altered  and his Passions are not eradicated. The fervour of  his Spirit is not abated nor the Irritability of his Nerves lessened.   11    
330,1771-05-09,This Day arrived Hall from  London with News of the Committment of the Mayor and Mr.  Alderman Oliver to the Tower by the House of Commons. I read this  Morning in the English Papers and the Political Register for April all the  Proceedings against the Printers Thompson and  Wheble and vs.  the Mayor and Alderman Wilks and  Oliver. What the Consequence will be of these Movements it  is not easy to foresee or Conjecture. A Struggle a Battle so serious and  determined between two such Bodies as the House and the City must produce  Confusion and Carnage without the most delicate Management on both sides or  the most uncommon Concurrence of Accidents.   13    
331,1771-05-14,Dr. Cooper mentioned an old Proverb that an  Ounce of Mother Wit is worth a Pound of Clergy. Mr. Otis mentioned another which he said conveyed  the same Sentiment -- an Ounce of Prudence is worth a Pound of Wit.  [  ] This produced a Dispute and the sense of the Company  was that the Word Wit in the 2d. Proverb meant the  faculty of suddenly raising pleasant Pictures in the Fancy but that the Phrase   14      Mother Wit in the first Proverb meant natural Parts and Clergy  acquired Learning -- Book Learning. Dr. Cooper  quoted another Proverb from his Negro Glasgow -- a Mouse can  build an House without Timble -- and then told us another Instance of  Glasgows Intellect of which I had before thought him entirely  destitute. The Dr. was speaking to  Glasgow about Adams Fall and the Introduction  of natural and moral Evil into the World and Glasgow said  they had in his Country a different Account of this matter. The Tradition was  that a Dog and a Toad were to run a Race and if the Dog reached the Goal  first the World was to continue innocent and happy but if the Toad should  outstrip the Dog the world was to become sinfull and miserable.  Every Body thought there could be no danger. But  in the Midst of the Career the Dog found a bone by the Way and stopped to knaw  it and while he was interrupted by his Bone the Toad constant in his  Malevolence hopped on [  ] reached the Mark and spoiled  the World   15    
332,1771-05-15,He will certainly soon relapse into his former Condition. He trembles. His  Nerves are irritable. He cannot bear Fatigue. -- Brother A.  has argued so prodigiously like a Rep [Representative] that  I cant help considering him as the Ghost of one -- &c.   16    
333,1771-05-22,At  Plymouth. Put up at Wetheralls near the County  House -- lodged with Mr. Angier where we had a  Chamber wholly to ourselves -- very still and retired -- very serene and happy.  Mrs. Howland and her Family I hear are very much grieved and  hurt and concerned about my passing by their House. But my Health is my Excuse  of all my Removals. I am not strong enough to bear the Smoke and dirt and  Noise of Howlands and their late Hours at night. -- Heard of  the Election of Coll.  Edson at  Bridgwater and Coll. Gilbert of  Freetown. Which proves to me that the System of the Province  will be different this Year from what it was the last. The House was very  near equally divided the whole of the last Session and these two  Members will be able to make a ballance in  favour of Timidity Cunning Artifice and  Trimming. How easily the People change and give up their Friends and their  Interest.   17    
334,1771-05-29,General Election. Went to  Boston and to  Cambridge and returned to  Boston at night.
335,1771-05-30,The Farmers upon  Connecticutt River fat their Cattle on the very best of English  Hay and Oats and Pees ground to meal. They would not digest the Corn whole  so they grind their Provender. One of the great Farmers will fatten 20 Head of  Cattle in a Year and it is the whole Business of one Man to take the care of  em -- to feed Water and curry them. They give an Ox but little Provender at  first but increase the Quantity till an Ox will eat a Peck at a Time twice a  day. [  ] The  County of Hampshire is the best Place to send to for Stock --  Oxen Cows Horses young Cattle of all Ages their Breed is large and  excellent and store Cattle are much cheaper there than below. -- Lodged at  Muns.
336,1771-05-31,A fair soft pleasant Morning. -- I believe the Peasants round about the  Town of Boston are as contracted in their Views and Notions as  any People in the Province. On the North Side of  Charlestown Ferry their Lands are divided into little Strips  and they spend the whole Year in providing for a few Cows and in carrying their  Milk in Bottles over the ferry and Wheeling it about the  Town of Boston. On the South Side of the Neck they raise Garden  Stuff and Hay for the Market. But they have less Conversation with Travellers  And   22      Strangers and therefore less Civility Knowledge &c.  [  ] than Countrymen at a greater Distance. --  Turned out my Horse at Coll.  Williams's  Marlborough. Dined at Martins  Northborough where I met with my Class Mate  Wheeler of  George Town the Episcopal Priest. He says the Deer in  St. James's Park are as tame as Catts  they will come up to you and eat any Thing out of  your Hands. There is a large Number of them in the Park and it is a rare Thing  to have one of them stolen or kill'd. It is  transportation to do Either. So there is a Number of Swans upon  the Thames none of em get killed nor any of their Eggs  destroyed. Mr. Wheeler informed me that Coll. Lithgow of  George Town had a Son which he designed to get me to take. He  is 20 Years of Age has studied Latin with Mr. Wheeler but  has never been at Colledge &c. He gives a  pitifull Account of our Classmate his Brother Bayley  [Bailey] and his Wife their want of CEconomy  and their wretched jig &c. -- Oated and drank Tea at  Furnaces lodged at Mr.  Putnams in  Worcester.
337,1771-06-01,This Day Mr. Putnams eldest Daughter  Eleanor brought to the World her first Daughter being  married to Rufus Chandler Son of Coll. John.   24    
338,1771-06-02,Jno. Chandler Esqr. of  Petersham came into P.s in the Evening from  Boston Yesterday and gave us an Account of  Mr. Otis's Conversion to Toryism. --  Adams was going on in the old Road and  Otis started up and said they had gone  far enough in that Way the Governor had an undoubted Right to carry the Court  where he pleased and moved for a Committee to represent the Inconveniences of  sitting there and moved for an Address to the Governor. He was a good Man --  the Ministers said so -- the justices said so and it must be so -- and moved to  go on with Business and the House voted every  Thing he moved for. --  Boston People say he is distracted. &c.   26    
339,1771-06-03,Oated at Silas Hodges's in  Brimfield near the baptist Meeting House. There I find they  have not so much faith in the Spring. Lodged at Colburns the  first House in  Stafford. There I found one David Orcutt who  came from  Bridgwater 30 Years ago a Relation of the  Orcutts in  Weymouth. He I find is also a great Advocate for the Spring. He  was miserable many Years with Rheumatism &c. and by means of the Spring  was now a comfortable Man. The Landlord came with   28      [his] Father 30 Years ago from  Roxbury. He has a farm of Zoo Acres of Land 100 under  Improvement keeps near 30 Head of neat Cattle 3 Horses 50 sheep and yet  offers to sell me his Place for 500 L.M.
340,1771-06-04,At Night Green call'd to his Wife come put by your Work and come in and  takes his Family Bible and reads a Chapter and then makes a long Prayer of  half an Hour and we all go to bed.   32    
341,1771-06-05,Thus I find I shall have in the Dr. a fund of Entertainment. He is  superficial enough and conceited enough and enthusiastical enough to  entertain.
342,1771-06-06,Mr. Barrell confirms the Account of  Mr. Otis's Behaviour in the House  which Mr. Chandler gave me at  Worcester. But says he cannot reconcile this to Mr.  Otis's whole Conduct for a Course of Years
343,1771-06-07,I begin to grow weary of this idle romantic jaunt. I believe  [it] would have been as well to have  staid in my own Country and amused myself with my  farm and rode to  Boston every day. I shall not suddenly take such a Ramble again  merely for my Health. I want to see my Wife my Children my Farm my Horse  Oxen Cows Walls Fences Workmen Office Books and Clerks. I want to hear  the News and Politicks of the Day. But here I am  at Bissills in  Windsor hearing my Landlord read a Chapter in the Kitchen and  go to Prayers with his Family in the genuine Tone of a Puritan.
344,1771-06-08,Looking into the Almanac I am startled. S [Superior] C  [Court]  Ipswich is the 18th. day of June. I thought it a Week later 25.  So that I have only next Week to go home 150 Miles. I must improve every  Moment. It is 25 miles a day if I ride every day next Week.
345,1771-06-09,Landlady has an only Son Nat. Shaylor and she is very fond  and very proud of him. He lived with a Merchant -- is now 25 or 26 and contents  himself still to keep that Merchants Books without any Inclination to set up  for himself. Is a great Proficient in Musick. Plays  upon the Flute Fife Harpsicord Spinnett &c. Associates with the Young  and the Gay and is a very fine  Connecticutt young Gentleman. Oh the Misery the Misfortune the  Ruin of being an only Son! I thank my God that I was not and I devoutly pray  that none of mine may ever be!
346,1771-06-10,Took my Departure from  Middleton homewards the same Way I went down. Very hot. Oated  at  Hartford and reached Bissills of  Winser 23 Miles before Dinner just as they had got their  Indian pudding and their Pork and Greens upon the Table one quarter after 12.  After Dinner attempted to cutt off an Angle by striking  over by  Goshen i.e.  Ellington to Kibbys at  Somers but lost my Way and got bewildered among Woods and  cross Paths and after riding 10 Miles to no Purpose returned to  Bissells and took the old Rout to  Enfield excessive hot. Lodged at Peases. But  passed a very restless uncomfortable Night. Overcome with Fatigue and inflamed  with Heat I could not sleep. And my Meditations on my Pillow were unhappy.   47    
347,1771-06-11,Rode to Kibbys at  Somers but got caught in the Rain -- very heavy  plentifull Showers -- I was much wet. Thus I have  hitherto had not very good Luck upon my homeward bound Voyage. Dined at  Kibbys and then rode over the Mountain to  Stafford went to the Spring and drank of the Waters with a  Gentleman from  New Jersey who was there with a Servant. Dr.  McKinstry was gone to  Brookfield to accompany  Mr. Barrell so far in his Way home.
348,1771-06-12,I have had a naked barren journey. My Brains have been as barren the whole  Time as a sandy Plain or a gravelly Nole. My Soul has been starved. Came off  just when Company   48      began to collect. This Week and the next would  have brought together a curious Collection of Characters from all Parts of  New England and some perhaps from the Southern Provinces and  some from the  W. Indies.
349,1771-06-13,Read this days Paper. The melodious Harmony the perfect Concords the  entire Confidence and Affection that seems to be restored greatly surprizes  me. Will it be lasting. I believe there is no Man in so curious a Situation as  I am. I am for what I can see quite left alone in the World.   52    
350,1771-06-14,A fine Morning.   53  [  --  ]  s 54 - 58  [ s -- no s available ]    [  -- ]    [  -- ]
351,1771-06-17,In this eloquent Strain of Grief did he run on. Millions of Thoughts did  this Conversation occasion me. I thought I should have had no Sleep all night  -- however I got to sleep and slept well.
352,1771-06-18,Rode with Mr. Barrell to  Ipswich and put up at  Treadwells. Every Object recalls the Subject of Grief.  Barrell all the Way to  Ipswich was like the Turtle bemoaning the Loss of his Mate.  Fine Season and beautifull Scenes but they did not charm him as they  used to. He had often rode this Way a Courting with infinite Pleasure  c.  I cant reallize that she has  left me forever. When she was well I often thought I could reallize the Loss of her but I was mistaken. I had no  Idea of it. -- In short this Mans Mournings have melted and softened me  beyond Measure.   5    
353,1771-06-22,I went this Evening spent an Hour and took a Pipe with Judge  Trowbridge at his Lodgings. He says  you will never get your Health till your Mind is at  ease. If you tire yourself with Business but especially with  Politicks you wont get well I said I dont  meddle with Politicks nor think about em. -- Except says he by Writing in the Papers.--  I'le be sworn says I I have not wrote one Line in a  Newspaper these two Years &c. -- The Judge says he had an Hint that  Foster   7      Hutchinson was appointed judge because  of the judgment of the Court in the Case of Spear vs. Keen. The Merchants took the Alarm and said that  instead of Lawyers they ought to have Merchants upon the Bench and  Mr. Hutchinson being both a Lawyer and  a Merchant he was the Man vs. the Governors  Determination a little time before. -- But this is one Instance among 1000 of  the Governors Disguise before those that he induces to believe has his entire  familiarity and Confidence. He made Mr. Goffe understand he  intended to make Worthington or some other Lawyer a judge  when he fully designed to make his Brother not indeed to please the Merchants  or because Foster was a Merchant but  because he was his Brother and that the family might have a Majority in that  Court. He is impenetrable to those who dont desire to reach any Imperfection in  him and who are determined not to fathom him where they may. The Bigotted  the Superstitious the Enthusiastical the Tools the Interested the Timid  are all dazzled with his Glare and cant see clearly when he is in the  Horizon.
354,1771-06-23,In the Morning my Horse was gone. Went to Meeting all day and heard old  Mr. Rogers -- a good well meaning man I believe. After  Meeting rode to  Newbury and visited Brother Lowell  Brother Farnham and then went and supped with Mr.  Jonathan Jackson in Company with Capt. Tracy Mr. Hooper  Mr. Williams Mr. Frasier  and Brother Lowell. Then went and lodged with  Lowell.   8    
355,1771-06-24,After Dinner rode to  York and put up at Ritchies with  Lowell and Bradbury.
356,1771-06-25,If I can so fence and secure Deacon Belchers and  Lt. Belchers Orchards as not to feed them at all in the Fall  Winter nor Spring I could get a fine Crop of English Hay from thence. But I  must keep up my Fences all Winter to keep off my Neighbours Creatures Hogs Horses Oxen Cows and  Sheep.
357,1771-06-26,Yesterday I had a good deal of Conversation with Judge  Trowbridge. He seems alarmed about the Powers of the Court of Probate.  He says if Judge Danforth was to die Tomorrow and the  Governor was to offer that Place to him he would not take it because he  thinks it ought always to be given to some Judge of the Inferiour Court and then some one Lawyer might be found  in each County who would take a Seat upon the Inferiour Bench if he could be made a Judge of Probate  at the same Time. He says he is utterly against Foster  Hutchinsons holding the Probate Office in  Boston if he takes his Place upon the Superior Bench -- and if  the Governor is an integral Part of the Court of Probate the Supreme  ordinary i.e. if he is not with the Members of the Council only Primus inter  Pares but has a Negative upon all their Decrees as Governor  Shirley Govr. Bernard and the late Secretary were  of Opinion he thinks we may be   12      in great Danger from the Court of  Probate and Judge Russell always opposed every Attempt to  extend the Power of the Court of Probate. -- He used to say We might have  Bishops here and the Court of Probate might get into their Hands and  therefore We ought to be upon our Guard.
358,1771-06-28,Sparhawk mentioned the Intrepidity of Sam  Adams a Man he says of great Sensibility of tender Nerves and  harrased dependant in their Power. Yet he had born up against all-it must  have penetrated him very deeply &c.   14    
359,1771-07-02,Saw Mr. Simmons at Court a Gentleman from  England who has been at  Falmouth a No. of  [years] as a Factor for several Merchants in  England purchasing Deals.   18    
360,1771-07-04,Spent the Evening with the Barr at Shattucks the Tavern  in high Spirits. Agreed unanimously to recommend Tim. Langdon  to be sworn. All in good Spirits very chearfull  and chatty -- many good stories &c. This day Argued the Cause of  Freeman and Child a Suit for 10 Penalty for taking  greater Fees in the Custom House than those allowed by the Province Law.
361,1771-07-05,Cadwallader Ford came to me this Morning and congratulated  me on the Verdict for Freeman. -- Sir says he I shall think  myself forever obliged to you for the Patriotick  manner in which you conducted that Cause. You have obtained great  Honour in this County by that Speech. I never heard a  better &c. -- All this is from old Cadwallader.  Langdon told me that a Man came running down when I had done  speaking and said That Mr. Adams has been making  the finest Speech I ever heard in my Life. He's equall  to the greatest orator that ever spoke in  Greece or  Rome. -- What an Advantage it is to have the Passions  Prejudices and Interests of the whole Audience in a Mans Favour.   19      These will convert plain common Sense  into profound Wisdom nay wretched Doggerell into sublime Heroics. This Cause  was really and in truth and without [  ] Partiality or  Affectation of Modesty very indifferently argued by me. But I have often been  surprized with Claps and Plauditts and Hosannas when I have spoke but  indifferently and as often met with Inattention and Neglect when I have  thought I spoke very well. -- How vain and empty is Breath!
362,1771-07-21,Tuesday went to  Boston with my Wife and the  next day to Commencement at  Cambridge was only at 3 Chambers -- Palmers  Frenches and Rogers's.
363,1771-07-22,I would not however conclude peremptorily against sending Sons or  Daughters to dancing or Fencing or Musick but had  much rather they should be ignorant of em all than fond  of any one of em.   52    
364,1771-07-23,The Indian Preacher cryed good God! -- that ever  Adam and Eve should eat that Apple when they  knew in their own Souls it would make good Cyder.   53    
365,1771-07-24,Dined at home i.e. at my Brother Smiths with  one Payson a Man who now lives at  Milton where Coll.  [  ] Gooch lived and who married a  Sister of David Wyers Wife.

367,1771-07-27,The Subject of the Governors Independency is a serious and momentous  Thing a dangerous and momentous Thing. It deserves the utmost  Attention.   54  [  --  ]   55

375,1771-11-10,Kent brought with him Utopia or the happy Republic a  Philosophical Romance by Sir Thos. More translated by  Bp. Burnet. There is a sensible Preface by the Translator  prefixed and some Testimonies concerning More by great and learned Men of  different Nations and Religions. Cardinal Pool  [Pole] Erasmus Jo.  Cochleus Paulus jovius Jo. Rivius  Charles 5. &c. The Translation I think is better  than mine which is by another Hand. The Romance is very elegant and  ingenious-the fruit of a benevolent and candid Heart a learned and strong  Mind. The good Humour Hospitality Humanity and  Wisdom of the Utopians is charming-their Elegance and Taste is engaging --  their freedom from Avarice and foppery and Vanity is admirable.   62  [  --  ]   63    
376,1772-02-02,Edwards is ballancing in his  Mind the several Professions in order to choose one. Is at a Loss between  Divinity and Law but his Inclination is to the latter. Asked me to take him. I  only answered there were such Swarms of young ones that there was no  Encouragement.
377,1772-02-04,My Brother seems to relish the Thought of a Commission and if  Rawson and Bass resign I hope he will have  one-under Billings.
378,1772-02-10,Went to  Boston to the Court of Admiralty and returned at Night. I went  upon the first Appeal that has been yet made and prosecuted before  Judge Auchmuty and as it is a new Thing the Judge has  directed an Argument and a Search of Books concerning the Nature of Appeals by  the civil Law. I found Time to look into Calvins Lexicon Title  Appellatio and Provocatio and into Maranta who has treated  largely of Appeals. Borrowed Ayliff but there is no Table and  could find nothing about the Subject. Domat I could not  find.   73    
379,1772-06-30,Have spent my idle Time in reading my Clasmate  Heminways Vindication of the Power Obligation and  Encouragement of the unregenerate to attend the Means of Grace -- and The  clandestine Marriage by Colman and  Garrick.

381,1772-10-05,Rode to  Plymouth with my Sister Miss Betsy  Smith. Most agreably entertained at the  House of Coll. Warren. The Colonel  his Lady and Family are all agreable. They have 5  Sons James now at Colledge  Winslow Charles Henry and  George-5 fine Boys.   104    
382,1772-10-06,At  Taunton. This Week has been a remarkable one.   105    
383,1772-10-19,The Day of the Month reminds me of my Birth day  which will be on the 30th. I was born Octr. 19.  1735. Thirty Seven Years more than half the Life of Man are run out. -- What  an Atom an Animalcule I am!-The Remainder of my Days I shall rather decline  in Sense Spirit and Activity. My Season for acquiring Knowledge is past. And  Yet I have my own and my Childrens Fortunes to make. My boyish Habits and Airs  are not yet worn off.   106    
384,1772-10-27,Trowbridge thought there never was a Time when  every Thing was so out of joint. Our general  Court gave   110      Cushing for a fortnights Work as much  as the Judges for a Years. The Ministry gave 600 a Year to the Admiralty  Judges for doing no more Business than the Superior Court did in one Term  tho the latter had a Controul over the former. For his Part he could not look  upon it in any other Light than as an Affront. This is nearly the same that he  said to Coll. Warren. Attended  Court all Day dined with the Judges &c. at Bradishes.  Brattle was there and was chatty. Fitch came  in blustering when Dinner was half over.  [     [ 4]  for entry dated November 21 1772. ]   111    
385,1772-11-21,When I chance to meet with any of my own Compositions of Ten Years old I  am much inclined to think I could write with more Accuracy and Elegance then  than I can now and that I had more Sense and Knowledge then than I have now.  My Memory and Fancy were certainly better then and my judgment  [  ] I conjecture quite as good.    [  -- ]    [  --  ]

389,1772-12-20,In the Afternoon Dr. Cooper sounded harmoniously upon the  deceitfullness of Sin. The Drs. Air and Action  are not gracefull -- they are not natural and easy.  His Motions with his Head Body and Hands are a little stiff and affected. His  Style is not simple enough for the Pulpit. It is too flowery too figurative --  his Periods too much or rather too apparently rounded and laboured. -- This however Sub Rosa because the Dr. passes  for a Master of Composition and is an excellent Man.   3    
390,1772-12-23,My Wife says her Father never inculcated any Maxim of Behaviour upon his Children so often as this -- never to  speak ill of any Body. To say all the handsome Things she could of Persons but  no Evil -- and to make Things rather than Persons the Subjects of Conversation.  These Rules he always impressed upon Us whenever We were going abroad if it  was but to spend an Afternoon. -- He was always remarkable for observing these  Rules in his own Conversation. -- Her Grandfather Quincy was  remarkable for never praising any Body He did not often speak evil but he  seldom spoke well.   4    
391,1772-12-24,This Day I heard that Mr. Hancock had purchased 20 Writs  of Mr. Goldthwait for this Court of Mr.  S. Quincy. -- Oh the Mutability of the legal commercial social  political as well as material World! For about 3 or 4 Years I have done all  Mr. Hancocks Business and have waded through wearisome  anxious Days and Nights in his Defence. But  Farewell!
392,1772-12-28,The high Commission Court the Star Chamber Court the Court of Inquisition  for the Tryal of the Burners of the  Gaspee at  Rhode Island are the present Topick of  Conversation.

395,1772-12-31,A Character can never [be] supported if  it can be raised without a good a great Share of Self Government. Such Flights  of Passion such Starts of Imagination tho they may  strike a few of the fiery and inconsiderate yet they lower they sink a Man  with the Wise. They expose him to danger as well as familiarity Contempt and  Ridicule.   11    
396,1773-01-01,Brattle has published a Narration of the Proceedings of the  Town of  Cambridge at their late Meeting and he has endeavoured to  deceive the World.   13    
397,1773-03-04,My own Determination had been to decline all Invitations to public Affairs  and Enquiries but Brattles rude indecent and unmeaning Challenge of me in  Particular laid me under peculiar Obligations to undeceive the People and  changed my Resolution. I hope that some good will come out of it. -- God  knows.   16    
398,1773-03-05,This however is no Reason why the Town should not call the Action of that  Night a Massacre nor against is it any Argument in  favour of the Governor or Minister who caused them to  be sent here. But it is the strongest of Proofs of the Danger of standing  Armies.   17    
399,1773-03-22,The Secrecy of these epistolary Genii is very remarkable -- profoundly  secret dark and deep.   18    
400,1773-04-07,What News shall we hear?
401,1773-04-24,My Men at Braintree have been building me a Wall this Week against my  Meadow. This is all the Gain that I make by my Farm to repay me my great  Expence. I get my Land better secured -- and  manured.

And the great Dragon was cast out that  old Serpent called the Devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole World: he was  cast out into the Earth and his Angells were cast out  with him. Q. Whether the Dr. had not some political  Allusions in the Choice of this Text.   20    
403,1773-05-25,After I got home my Wife surprized me. She had  been to Justice Quincys. Mr. Hancock came in  and gave before a large Company of both Sexes to Mr. Cooper a  particular Account of all the Plans of Operation   23      for tomorrow  which he and many others had been concerting. Cooper no doubt  carried it directly to Brattle or at least to his Son Thomas.  Such a leaky Vessell is this worthy Gentleman.

Mr. Miffling is a Grandson his Mother was the Daughter of  Mr. Bagnall of this Town who was buried the day before  Yesterday. Mr. Miffling is a Representative of the City of  Phyladelphia - a very sensible and  agreable Man. Their Accademy emits from 9 to 14. Graduates annually. Their  Grammar School has from 90 to 100 schollars in all. Mr.  Miffling is an easy Speaker - and a very correct Speaker.
406,1773-07-16,Spent the Evening with Cushing Adams  Pemberton and Swift at  Wheelwrights - no body very chatty but  Pemberton.
407,1773-08-23,In the Evening I waited on my Wife there and  found Mr. Linch and his Lady and Daughter Mr.  Smith his Lady and Daughter and Miss Nabby Taylor  -- and a very agreable Evening we had. Mr.  Linch is a solid sensible tho a plain Man  -- an hearty friend to America and her righteous Cause. His Lady has the  Behaviour and Appearance of a very worthy Woman  and the Daughter seems to be worthy of such Parents.   27    
408,1773-08-30,Mr. Lynch still maintains the Character. Coll.  Howorth attracted no Attention untill he  discovered his Antipathy to a catt.   28

411,1774-02-28,The North Common Pasture has a numerous Growth of Red Cedars upon it  perhaps 1000 which in 20 years if properly pruned may be worth a Shilling  each. It is well walled in all round. The Prunings of those Cedars will make  good Browse for my Cattle in Winter and good fuel when the Cattle have picked  off all they will eat. There is a Quantity of good Stone in it too.   3    
412,1774-03-02,About 9 at Night I step'd over the Way and took a Pipe with Justice  Quincy and a Mr. Wendel of  Portsmouth. Mr. Wendell seems a Man of Sense  and Education   5      and not ill affected to the public Cause.
413,1774-03-05,The Happiness of the Family where I dined upon account of the Colls. justly  applauded Oration was complete. The Justice and his Daughters were all  joyous.   6

418,1774-03-11,The Right of private judgment and the Liberty of Conscience was claimed by  the Papists and allowed them in the reign of James 2d.But has been prohibited by Law ever since. The  Advocates for the Administration now in  America claim the Right of private judgment to overthrow the  Constitution of this Province the Priviledges of  all  America and british Liberties into the Bargain -- sed Non  allocatur.
419,1774-03-12,The same Spirit spreads like a Contagion into all the other Colonies into  Ireland and into  Great Britain too from this single Province of  Mass. Bay that no Pains are too great to be taken no Hazards  too great to be run for the Destruction of our Charter.
420,1774-03-13,Heard Mr. Lothrop [Lathrop] in the  Forenoon and Dr. Cooper in the Afternoon. Last evening  justice Pemberton spent with me. He says that Moses  Gill has made many justices by lending Money.   12    
421,1774-03-28,Rode with Brother Josiah Quincy to  Ipswich Court. Arrived at Piemonts in  Danvers in good order and well conditioned. Spent the evening  and lodged agreably. Walked out in the Morning to  hear the Birds sing.

422,1774-03-29,At a Meeting of the Bar a Doubt of Brother Lowell was  mentioned upon the Law of the Prov [Province]  [  ] for the Relief of poor Prisoners for Debt.

423,1774-03-30,A dull Day. My Head is empty but my Heart is full. I am wanted at my  Office but not wanted here. There is Business there but none here.  My Wife perhaps wants to see me. I am anxious  about her. I cannot get the Thoughts of her State of Health out of my Mind. I  think she must remove to  Braintree -- and I and the Family at least for the  Season.

427,1774-08-15,We went up the Steeple of  Weathersfield Meeting House from whence is the most grand and  beautifull Prospect in the World at least that I  ever saw. Then We rode to  Middleton and lodged at Bigelows. There  Mr. Hobby and another Gentleman came to see us.   3    
428,1774-08-16,The Numbers of Gentlemen who have waited on Us from Hartford to this Place  the Heat of the Weather and the shortness of the Time have made it impossible  for me to learn the Names.   5    
429,1774-08-17,This Afternoon and Evening We had a plentifull  Rain.   7    
430,1774-08-18,After noon We rode to Quintards of  Norwalk where we are to put up having rode 36 Miles and  having 50 Miles to  N. York.
431,1774-08-19,Rode to Fitch's of  Stamford where we breakfasted. Rode to  Havilands of  Rye the first Town in the Province of  N. York. The Barber says that Religion dont flourish in this  Town. The congregational Society have no Minister. The Church minister has  45 from the Society. They have a School for Writing and Cyphering but  no Grammar School. There is no Law of this Province that requires a Minister or  school Master.
432,1774-08-20,In our Walks they shewed us the House of  Mr. William Smith one of their Council and the famous Lawyer  -- Mr. Thomas Smith &c. Mr. Rivington's  Store &c.   12    
433,1774-08-21,We then went to Mr. David Vanhorns who sent his  Compliments to Mr. McDougal and requested him to introduce Us  to his House as he was sick and unable to come out. He seems well affected to  the public Cause and speaks very sensibly about it.
434,1774-08-22,P. V. Livingston is a sensible Man and a Gentleman -- he  has been in Trade is rich and now lives upon his Income. Phill.  Livingston is a great rough rappid Mortal.  There is no holding any Conversation with him. He blusters away. Says if  England should turn us adrift we should instantly go to civil  Wars among ourselves to determine which Colony should govern all the rest.  Seems to dread  N. England -- the Levelling Spirit &c. Hints were thrown out  of the Goths and Vandalls -- mention was made of our hanging the Quakers  c. I told him the very Existence of the Colony was at that Time at Stake  -- surrounded with Indians at War against whom they could not have defended  the Colony if the Quakers had been permitted to go on.
435,1774-08-23,With all the Opulence and Splendor of this City there is very little good  Breeding to be found. We have been treated with an assiduous Respect. But I  have not seen one real Gentleman one well bred Man since I came to Town. At  their Entertainments there is no Conversation that is agreable. There is no Modesty -- No Attention to one  another. They talk very loud very fast and Altogether. If they ask you a  Question before you can utter 3 Words of your Answer they will break out upon  you again -- and talk away.   23    
436,1774-08-24,This Day Cushing and Paine went over to  Long Island to dine with Phill. Livingston.  Adams and I sent our Excuse that we were not very well. It was  raw and wett.
437,1774-08-25,After Dinner the  Connecticutt Delegates came in. In the Evening several Gentlemen  came to our Lodgings and among others Mr. Sears.
438,1774-08-26,This Morning We went to see the City Hall the Chamber where the  Supream Court sitts and  that where the Mayor and Recorder sit. Afterwards We went down to the new Dutch  Church which is a much more elegant Building than  St. Pauls -- it is the most elegant Building in the City. The  Pillars are smaller than Dr. Coopers and the Pews are all  painted but the Building is not so handsome. At Nine o Clock We crossed  Powlus Hook Ferry to  N. Jersey -- then  Hackinsack Ferry then  Newark Ferry and dined at  Elizabeth Town. After Dinner We rode twenty miles crossed  Brunswick Ferry and put up at Farmers in the  City of Brunswick. That Part of the Province of  New Jersey which We have passed is all upon a Level -- as fine a  Road as ever was trod. Yet the Lands seem to be good.   27    
439,1774-08-27,By the Account of Whitwell and Pidgeon  the Government of this Colledge is very Strict and  the Schollars study very hard. The President says  they are all Sons of Liberty.
440,1774-08-28,Smith he says is the oracle of  New York for Chamber Council. Scott is a  Character very much like that of old Mr. Auchmuty. Set up all  Night at his Bottle.   31      Yet argue to Admiration next Day. An  admirable Speaker according to him. Duane is a plodding Body  but has a very effeminate feeble Voice. He says the Virginians speak in  Raptures about Richard Henry Lee and Patrick  Henry -- one the Cicero and the other the  Demosthenes of the Age. Jo Reed is at the  Head of his Profession in  Philadelphia. Fisher is next.  Walln and Dickenson have  retired.
441,1774-08-29,A Gentleman who returned into Town with Mr. Paine and me in  our Coach undertook to caution us against two Gentlemen particularly. One was  Dr. Smith the Provost of the Colledge who is looking up to Government for an American  Episcopate and a Pair of lawn Sleeves. Soft polite insinuating adulating  sensible learned industrious indefatigable he has had Art enough and  Refinement upon Art to make Impressions even on Mr. Dickinson  and Mr. Reed.
442,1774-08-30,Dr. Shippen then carried Us into his Chamber where he  shewed Us a Series of Anatomical Paintings of  exquisite Art. Here was a great Variety of Views of the human Body whole and  in Parts. The Dr. entertained us with a very clear concise and comprehensive  Lecture upon all the Parts of the human Frame. This Entertainment charmed me.  He first shewed us a Set of Paintings of Bodies  entire and alive -- then of others with the Skin taken off then with the first  Coat of [  ] Muscles taken off then with the second then  with all -- the bare bones. Then he shewed Us  paintings of the Insides of a Man seen before all the Muscles of the Belly  being taken off. The Heart Lungs Stomach Gutts.   36    
443,1774-08-31,Mrs. Lynch enquired kindly  after Mrs. Adams's Health and Mrs.  Smith and family and Mr. Boylstone And Mrs.  and Mr. Gill &c.
444,1774-09-01,[  ] I find that there is a Tribe of People here  exactly like the Tribe in the  Massachusetts of Hutchinsonian Addressers. There is indeed a  Sett in every Colony. We have seen the Revolutions of  their Sentiments. Their Opinions have undergone as many Changes as the Moon. At  the Time of the Stamp Act and just before it they professed to be against the  Parliamentary Claim of Right to tax Americans to be Friends to our  Constitutions our Charter &c. Bernard was privately  secretly endeavouring to procure an Alteration of our Charter. But he concealed  his Designs untill his Letters were detected.  Hutchinson professed to be a stanch Friend to Liberty and to  our Charter untill his Letters were detected -- a  great Number of good People thought him a good Man and a Sincere Friend to the  Congregational Interest in Religion and to our Charter Priviledges. They went on with this machiavilian  Dissimulation untill those Letters were detected --  after that they waited untill the  Boston Port Bill was passed and then thinking the People must  submit immediately and that Lord North would carry his  whole System triumphantly they threw off the Mask. Dr. Smith  Mr. Galloway Mr. Vaughan and others in this  Town are now   40      just where the Hutchinsonian Faction were in the  Year 1764 [1765] when We were endeavouring to obtain a  Repeal of the Stamp Act.
445,1774-09-02,These Gentlemen from  Virginia appear to be the most spirited and consistent of any.  Harrison said he would have come on foot rather than not come.  Bland said he would have gone upon this Occasion if it had  been to  Jericho.
446,1774-09-03,He says that George Haley is the worst Enemy to  America that he knew there -- swore to him that he would stand  by Government in all its Measures and was allways  censuring and cursing  America.   45  [  --  ]   46  [  -- ]    [  -- ]    [  -- ]
447,1774-09-04,Went in the Afternoon to Christ Church and heard Mr.  Coombs [Coombe]. This is a more noble Building and  a genteeler Congregation. The Organ and a new Choir of Singers were very  musical. Mr. Coombs is celebrated here as a fine Speaker. He  is sprightly has a great deal of Action speaks distinctly. But I confess I  am not charmed with his oratory. His Style was indifferent his Method  confused. In one Word his Composition was vastly inferiour to the ordinary Sermons of  our HowHuntChaunceyCooperElliot  and even Stillman. Mr. Mifflin spent the  Sunday Evening with Us at our Lodgings.
448,1774-09-05,This is a Question of great Importance. -- If We vote by Colonies this  Method will be liable to great Inequality and Injustice for 5 small Colonies  with 100000 People in each may outvote 4 large ones each of which has 500000  Inhabitants. If We vote by the Poll some Colonies have more than their  Proportion of Members and others have less. If We vote by Interests it will  be attended with insuperable Difficulties to ascertain the true Importance of  each Colony. -- Is the Weight of a Colony to be ascertained by the Number of  Inhabitants merely -- or by the Amount of their Trade the Quantity of their  Exports and Imports or by any compound Ratio of both. This will lead us into  such a Field of Controversy as will greatly perplex us. Besides I question  whether it is possible to ascertain at this Time the Numbers of our People or  the Value of our Trade. It will not do in such a Case to take each other's  Words.

549,1777-02-08,Dined at the Presidents with Mr.  Lux Messrs. Samuel and Robert  Purveyance Capt.  Nicholson of the Maryland Frigate [the  Virginia] Coll. Harrison  Wilson Mr. Hall -- upon  New England Salt fish. The Weather was rainy and the Streets  the muddiest I ever saw. -- This is the dirtyest  Place in the World -- our  Salem and  Portsmouth are neat in Comparison. The Inhabitants however are  excusable because they had determined to pave the Streets before this War came  on since which they have laid the Project aside as they are accessible to Men  of War. This Place is not incorporated. It is neither a City Town nor  Burrough so that they can do nothing with  Authority.   3    
550,1777-02-09,On my Return I stopped and drank Tea at Captn.  Smiths a Gentleman of the new Assembly.   4    
551,1777-02-16,Last Evening I supped with my Friends Dr. Rush and  Mr. Sergeant at Mrs. 's over the Bridge.  The two Coll.  Lees Dr. Witherspoon Mr.  Adams Mr. Gerry Dr. Brownson made  the Company. They have a Fashion in this Town of reversing the Picture of  King G. 3d in such Families as have it. One of these Topsy  Turvy Kings was hung up in the Room where we supped and under it were written  these Lines by Mr. Throop as we were told.  Behold the Man who had it in his Power  To make a Kingdom tremble and adore  Intoxicate with Folly See his Head  Plac'd where the meanest of his Subjects tread  Like Lucifer the giddy Tyrant fell  He lifts his Heel to Heaven but points his Head to Hell.
552,1777-02-17,Mr. H. [Hancock] told C.W.  [Colonel Whipple?] Yesterday that he had  determined to go to  Boston in April. Mrs. H. was not willing to go  till May but Mr. H. was determined upon April. -- Perhaps the  Choice of a Governor may come on in May... What aspiring little Creatures we  are! -- how subtle sagacious and judicious this Passion is! how clearly it  sees its object how constantly it pursues it and what wise Plans it devises  for obtaining it!
553,1777-02-21,This Morning received a long Card from Mr.  H. expressing great Resentment about fixing the Magazine at  Brookfield against the Book  binder and the General. The Complaisance to  me and the Jealousy for the  Massachusetts in this   6      Message indicate to me the  same Passion and the same design with the journey to  B. [Boston] in April.
554,1777-02-23,The Manners of  Maryland are somewhat peculiar. They have but few Merchants.  They are chiefly Planters and Farmers. The Planters are those who raise Tobacco  and the Farmers such as raise Wheat &c. The Lands are cultivated and all  Sorts of Trades are exercised by Negroes or by transported Convicts which has  occasioned the Planters and Farmers to assume the Title of Gentlemen and they  hold their Negroes and Convicts that is all labouring People and Tradesmen in such Contempt that  they think themselves a distinct order of Beings. Hence they never will suffer  their Sons to labour or learn any Trade but they  bring them up in Idleness or what is worse in Horse Racing Cock fighting and  Card Playing.   8    
555,1777-02-28,The object of the Men of Property here the Planters &c. is  universally Wealth. Every Way in the World is sought to get and save Money.  Landjobbers -- Speculators in Land -- [  ] little  Generosity to the Public -- little public Spirit.
556,1777-09-15,We live in critical Moments! Mr. Howes Army is at  Middleton and  Concord. Mr. Washingtons upon the  Western Banks of Schuylkill a few Miles from him. I saw this  Morning an excellent Chart of the  Schuylkill  Chester River  the Brandywine and this whole Country among the  Pensilvania Files. This City is the Stake for which the Game is  playd. I think there is a Chance for saving it  although the Probability is against Us. Mr. Howe I conjecture  is waiting for his Ships to come into  the Delaware. Will W. attack him? I hope so --  and God grant him Success.   10    
557,1777-09-16,It is reported too that Mr. How lost great Numbers in the  Battle of  the Brandywine.
558,1777-09-18,This Dispensation will save Us much Altercation.   13    
559,1777-09-19,Mr. Merchant and myself arose sent for our Horses and  after collecting our Things rode off after the others. Breakfasted at  Bristol where were many Members determined to go the  Newtown Road to  Reading. We rode to  Trenton where We dined. Coll. Harrison  Dr. Witherspoon all the Delegates from  N.Y. and  N.E. except Gerry and Lovell.  Drank Tea at Mr. Spencers lodged at Mr. S.  Tuckers at his kind Invitation.
560,1777-09-20,Mrs. Tucker has about 1600 st. in some of the Funds  in  England which she is in fear of loosing. She is accordingly  passionately wishing for Peace and that the Battle was fought once for all  c. Says that private Property will be plundered where there is an Army   15      whether of Friends or Enemies. That if the two opposite  Armys were to come here alternately ten times she  would stand by her Property untill she should be  kill'd. If she must be a Beggar it should be where  she was known &c. This kind of Conversation shews  plainly enough how well she is pleased with the State of Things.
561,1777-09-21,We have as good a Cause as ever was fought for. We have great Resources.  The People are well tempered. One active masterly Capacity would bring order  out of this Confusion and save this Country.
562,1777-09-22,Breakfasted at Ringolds in  Quaker Town dined at Shannons in  Easton at the Forks slept at Johnsons in  Bethlehem.

We walked among the  Rowes of Cherry Trees with spacious orchards of Apple  Trees on each Side of the Cherry Walk. The Society of Single Men have turned  out for the sick.
564,1777-09-24,Fine Morning. We all went to Meeting last Evening where Mr.  Edwine gave the People a short discourse in German and the  Congregation sung and the organ playd. There were  about 200 Women and as many Men. The Women sat together in one Body and the Men  in another. The Women dressed all alike. The Womens Heads resembled a Garden of  white Cabbage Heads.   20    
565,1777-09-25,Rode from  Bethlehem through  Allan Town Yesterday to a German Tavern about 18 Miles from  Reading. Rode this Morning to  Reading where We breakfasted and heard for certain that  Mr. Howes Army had crossed  the Schuylkill. Coll. Hartley gave me an  Account of the late Battle between the Enemy and General  Wayne. Hartley thinks that the Place was improper for  Battle and that there ought to have been a Retreat.   21    
566,1777-11-17,Dined at Brewsters in  Orange County State of New York. Brewsters  Grandfather as he tells me was a Clergyman and one of the first  Adventurers to  Plymouth. He died at 95 Years of Age a Minister on  Long Island left a son who lived to be above 80 and died  leaving my Landlord a son who is now I believe between 60 and 70.   23      The Manners of this Family are exactly like those of the  N.E. People. A decent Grace before and after  Meat -- fine Pork and Beef and Cabbage and Turnip.

572,1778-02-14,My Lodging was a Cott with a double Mattress a good  Bolster my own Sheets and Blanketts enough. My  little Son with me -- We lay very comfortably and slept well. A violent Gale  of Wind in the Night.
573,1778-02-15,This Morning weigh'd the last Anchor and came under Sail before Breakfast.  A fine Wind and a pleasant Sun but a sharp cold Air. Thus I bid farewell to  my native Shore. -- Arrived and anchored in the Harbour of  Marblehead about Noon. Major  Reed Captn. Gatchell Father  in Law of Capt. Tucker came on  board and a Captain Stevens who came on Board to make me a  present of a single Pistol.   5    
574,1778-02-16,Thus I find myself invested with the unexpected Trust of a Kind of  Guardianship of two promising young Gentlemen besides my own Son. This  benevolent office is peculiarly agreable to my  Temper. Few Things have ever given me greater Pleasure than the Tuition of  Youth to the Bar and the Advancement of Merit.
575,1778-02-17,Our Captn. is an able Seaman and a brave  active vigilant officer but I believe has no great Erudition. His Library  consists of Dyche's English Dictionary Charlevoix's Paraguay The Rights of  the Xtian Church asserted vs. the Romish and other  Priests who claim an independent Power over it The 2d Vol. of Chubbs posthumous Works 1. Vol. of the History  of Charles Horton Esq. and 1. Vol. of the delicate  Embarrassments a Novell. -- I shall at some other Time  take more Notice of some of these Books.   8    
576,1778-02-18,Last night about Sunsett We sailed out of  Marblehead Harbour and have had a  fine Wind from that time to this 24. Hours. The constant Rolling and Rocking  of the Ship last night made Us all sick -- half the Sailors were so. My young  Gentlemen Jesse and Johnny were taken about  12 O Clock last night and have been very seasick ever since. I was seized with  it myself this Forenoon. My Servant Joseph  Stevens and the Captns. Will have both been very bad.
577,1778-02-19,In the Morning We discovered three Sail of Vessells ahead. We went near enough to discover them to be  Frigates and then put away. We soon lost sight of two of them: but the third  chased Us the whole Day. Sometimes We gained upon her and sometimes she upon  Us.
578,1778-02-20,In the Morning nothing to be seen but soon after another Sail discovered  ahead which is supposed to be the same.
579,1778-02-21,On one of these Nights a Thunder bolt struck 3 Men upon deck and wounded  one of them a little by a Scorch upon his Shoulder. It also struck our Main  Topmast.   10    
580,1778-02-24,I confess I often regretted that I had brought my son. I was not so clear  that it was my Duty to expose him as myself but I had been led to it by the  Childs Inclination and by the Advice of all my Friends. Mr.  Johnnys Behaviour gave me a Satisfaction  that I cannot expressfully sensible of our Danger he was constantly endeavouring to bear it with a manly Patience very  attentive to me and his Thoughts constantly running in a serious Strain.   11    
581,1778-02-26,This Morning Captn. Tucker made  me a Present of Charlevoix's History of  Paraguay. Yesterday Dr. Noel put into my Hand  a Pockett Volume intituled Le Geographe manuel contenant La Description  de tous les Pays du Monde leurs qualits leur climat le  caractre de leurs Habitans leur Villes capitales avec leur distances  de  Paris et des Routes qui y menent tant par terre que par Mer  les Changes et les Monnoies des principales Places de l'Europe en Correspondance avec  Paris la manire de tenir les Ecritures de chaque  Nation la Reduction de toutes especes de I'Europe au pied courant de France  c. Par M. l'Abb Expilly de la Socit royale des  Sciences et belles Lettres de Nancy. These manuals come out annually and are  to be had in any of the great Towns in France.
582,1778-02-27,Yesterday the Captn. brought in a Curiosity which  he had drawn up over the Side in a Buckett of Water  which the Sailors call a Portuguese Man of War and to  day I have seen many of them sailing by the Ship. They have some  Appearances of Life and Sensibility. They spread a curious Sail and are wafted  along very briskly. They have something like Gutts  hanging down which are said to be in a degree poisonous to human Flesh. The  Hulk is like blue Glass. I pierced it with the sharp Point of my Pen Knife and  found it empty. The Air came out and the Thing shrunk up almost to  nothing.   14    
583,1778-02-28,What is this Gulph Stream? What is the Course of it?  From what Point and to what Point does it flow? How broad is it? How far  distant is it from the  Continent of America? What is the Longitude and Latitude of  it.   15    
584,1778-03-01,I hope for the future We shall carry less Sail especially of nights and at  all Times when We are not in Chase.
585,1778-03-02,This Evening the Wind is very fresh and the Ship sails at a great Rate. We  are out of the Reach I hope of the Gulph Stream and of  British Cruizers two Evils which I have a great  Aversion to.   16    
586,1778-03-03,Dr. Noel shewed me Dictionaire  geographique portatif which is a Translation of Echards Gazetteer into  French Par Monsr. Vosgien Chanoine de Vaucouleurs.   17

590,1778-03-07,This Morning the Captain ordered all Hands upon Deck and took an account of  the Number of Souls on board which amounted to 172. Then he ordered the  Articles of War to be read to them -- after which he ordered all Hands upon the  Forecastle and then all Hands upon the Quarter deck in order to try  Experiments for determining whether any difference was made in the Ships  sailing by the Weight of the Men being forward or abaft. Then all Hands were  ordered to their Quarters to exercise them at the Guns. Mr.  Barron gave the Words of Command and they spent an Hour perhaps in the  Exercise at which they seemed tolerably expert. Then the Captain ordered a  Dance upon the Main Deck and all Hands Negroes Boys and Men were obliged to  dance. After this the old Sailors set on Foot another Frolic called the  Miller or the Mill. I will not spend Time to describe this odd Scaene: but it ended in a very high frolic in which almost  all the Men were powdered over with Flour and wet again to the Skin. --  Whether these whimsical Diversions are indulged in order to make the Men wash  themselves and shft their Cloaths and to wash away  Vermin I don't know But there is not in them the least Ray of  Elegance very little Wit and a humour of the  coarsest Kind. It is not superiour to Negro and  Indian Dances.   21    
591,1778-03-08,The late Storm shewed the Beauty of Boileaus  Description d'une Tempte.  Comme l'on voit les Hots soulevez par forage  Fondre sur un Vaisseau qui s'oppose a leur rage  Le Vent avec fureur dans les voiles fr  La mer blanchit d'cume et fair au loin gmit  Le matelot trouble que son Art abandonne  Croit voir dans chaque flot la mort qui l'environne.  Trad. de Longin.   22    
592,1778-03-09,Last Night the Wind shifted to the N. West and blew fresh. It is now still  fairer for Us than before. The Weather is fine and We go on our Voyage at a  great Rate. Some Officers think We shall reach our Port by Thursday night  others by Saturday night: But these make no Account of Chases and Cruises and  make no Allowance for the Variability of the Winds.
593,1778-03-14,Mr. Barrons bore it with great Fortitude and Magnanimity --  thought he should die and frequently intreated me to take Care of his Family.  He had an helpless Family he said and begged that I would take Care of his  Children. I promised him that by the first Letters I should write to  America I would earnestly recommend his Children to the Care of  the Public as well as of Individuals. I cannot but think the Fall of this  Officer a great Loss to the united  States... His Prudence his Moderation his Attention his Zeal  were Qualities much wanted in our Navy. He is by Birth a Virginian.   24    
594,1778-03-19,The Wind has been directly against Us but this Morning has veered and We  now steer at least our Head lies by the Compass South East. -- Who knows but  Providence has favoured Us by the last Gale as it  seemed to do by the first. -- By the last Gale We have already escaped Cruizers as  We did by the first -- and possibly this violent Gale from the south East may  have driven all the Cruizers from the  Coast of Spain and the Southerly Part of the  Bay of Biscay and by this Means have opened a clear Passage for  Us to Bourdeaux. This is possible -- and so is the contrary. God  knows --
595,1778-03-20,We have now so fine a Wind that a very few days will determine whether We  shall meet any capital Disaster or arrive safe at Port.

598,1778-03-28,Numbers of small Birds from the Shore came along to  day some of them fatigued allighted on our  Rigging Yards &c. and one of them We caught. A little Lark he was called.  These Birds loose the Shore and get lost and then  fly untill they are so fatigued that the instant  they allight upon a Ship they drop to sleep.   28    
599,1778-03-29,I feel a Curiosity to visit this  Island of Oleron so famous in Antiquity for her Sea Laws at  least I take this to be the Place.

We dined there in the Fashion  of the Country. We had fish and Beans and Salad and Claret  Champain and Mountain Wine. After Dinner Mr. Bondfield who is Agent here invited me to  take a Walk which We did to his Lodgings where We drank Tea. Then We walked  about the Town and to see the new Comedie. After  this We went to the Opera where the Scenery the Dancing the Music afforded  to me a very chearfull sprightly Amusement having  never seen any Thing of the Kind before. After this  We returned to Mr. McClarys Lodgings where We supped.   34    
603,1778-04-02,Walked round the Town to see the Chamber and Council of Commerce the  Parliament which was sitting where We heard the Council. Then We went round to  the Ship Yards &c.

606,1778-04-05,Proceeded on our journey more than 100 Miles.
607,1778-04-06,Arrived at  Poictiers the City so famous for the Battle which was fought  here. It is a beautifull situation and the  Cultivation of the Plains about it is exquisite. The Houses are old and poor  and the Streets very narrow. Afternoon passed thro  Chatelerault another City nearly as large  as Poictiers and as old and the Streets as narrow. When We  stopped at the Post to change our Horses about 20 young Women came about  the Chaise with their elegant Knives scissors tooth  Picks &c. to sell. The Sceene was new to me and  highly diverting. Their eagerness to sell a Knife was as great as that of  some Persons I have seen in other Countries to get Offices. We arrived in the  Evening at  Ormes the magnificent Seat of the Marquis  D'Argenson. It is needless to make particular Remarks upon this  Country. Every Part of it is cultivated. The Fields of Grain the Vineyards  the Castles the Cities the Parks the Gardens every  Thing is beautifull: yet every Place swarms  with Beggars.   36    
608,1778-04-07,Travelled from  Les Ormes the splendid Seat of the Marquis  D'Argenson to Mer. We went through  Tours and  Amboise and several other smaller  Villages.Tours is the most elegant Place We have yet seen. It  stands upon  the River Loire which empties itself at  Nantes. We rode upon a Causey made in the  River Loire for a great Number of Miles. The Meadows and River  Banks were extremely beautifull.
609,1778-04-08,We passed the Bridge last Night over  the Seine and passed thro  the Louvre. The Streets were crowded with Carriages with Livery  Servants.   37    
610,1778-04-09,Dr. Franklin presented to me the Compliments of Mr. Turgot lately  Comptroller of the Finances and his Invitation to dine with him. Went  with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee and  dined in Company with the Dutchess D'Anville the Mother of  the Duke De Rochefoucault and twenty of the great People  of France. -- It is in vain to Attempt a Description of the  Magnificence of the House Gardens Library Furniture or the Entertainment of  the Table. Mr. Turgot has the Appearance of a grave sensible  and amiable Man. Came home and supped with Dr.  Franklin on Cheese and Beer.
611,1778-04-10,Dined at Monsr. Brillon's with many Ladies and Gentlemen.... Madam Brillon is a Beauty and a great Mistress of Music  as are her two little Daughters....

673,1778-11-09,At Dinner I repeated this Paragraph to Dr. Franklin and  said that I thought  Mr. H's journey ought to be forbidden. The Dr. said  he did not see how his coming could be forbid.

Says There are  Two hundred and Thirty Sail of Merchand Ships lying  at the Mother Bank near  Spithead ready to sail to the  West Indies loaded with all Kinds of Provisions and dry Goods  and Warlike Stores. They are to be joined by about Thirty Sail that now lay in  the Downs. They are to sail the first Wind after the two Fleets join. The Wind  must be easterly. They all go to the  Barbadoes where the Fleet for the  Windward Islands seperates from that to the  Leward Islands. They are to be convoyed out of the Channell by Twelve Ships of the Line Six of them to go  through the Voyage to the  W.I. Islands. -- As they commonly exagerate it is probable that not so many Men of War  will go. There may be 8 or 9 Men of War go out of the Channell and perhaps two or three go thro the Voyage. They cannot probably spare 6 Vessells of the Line without leaving the French Masters of  the Seas.   75    
677,1779-02-02,M. Raynal is the most eloquent Man I ever heard speak in  French. His Voice is sharp and clear but pleasant. He talks a great deal and  is very entertaining. M. Gebelin is much less addicted to  talking. He is silent soft and still. His Mind always upon the Stretch.

680,1779-02-08,In all this it is easy to see there is too much Declamation but the  substantial Meaning of it is as appears to me exactly true as such as I  will abide by unless future Evidence which I dont expect should convince me  of any Error in it.   78    
681,1779-02-09,On Dr. F. the Eyes of all  Europe are fixed as the most important Character in American  Affairs in  Europe. Neither L. nor myself are looked upon of much  Consequence. The Attention of the Court seems most to F. and no Wonder. His  long and great Rep. [Reputation] to which L's and mine are in  their infancy are enough to Account for this. His Age and real Character  render it impossible for him to search every Thing to the Bottom and L. with  his privy Council are evermore contriving. The Results of their Contrivances  render many Measures more difficult.   81    
682,1779-02-11,It is my indispensable Duty to tell the Comte de  Vergennes that I think one great Cause of this horrid Address  of Mr. Deane is Mr.  Franklins Certificate in his favour that he  was is an able and faithfull Negotiator  and that Mr. Franklin was deceived in this -- Mr.  F. that Mr. F.'s Knowledge actually in  America for a great Many Years has not been long -- that he was  Upright in this but deceived. That there are such certain and Infallible Proofs  of Vanity Presumption Ambition Avarice and Folly in Mr.  Deane as render him very unworthy of Confidence and therefore  that Dr. F. has been deceived.   93    
683,1779-02-12,The greatest Relief to my Mind that I have ever found since the Appearance  of the Address. Now Business may be done by Dr.  Franklin alone. Before it seemed as if nothing could be done.

Perhaps few Men have guessed more exactly than I have been allowed to do upon  several Occasions but at this Time which is the first I declare of my whole  Life I am wholly at a Loss to foresee Consequences.   95

687,1779-03-12,Mr. Jno. Lloyd is a sensible Man. He says that the french  officers of Marine consider Convoys as a disgracefull Service. They hate to be ordered to  convoy Merchant Vessells. That when a Convoy is  ordered the officer is negligent and the Merchant dares not complain. The  Marine officers and Police officers and Custom house officers are connected  together and if a Merchant complains he is marked out as an obnoxious Person  and Advantages are taken of him so that he hold his Tongue.   2    
688,1779-04-14,Had some Conversation with Mr. Johnson on the subject of a  free Port. The Q. [Question] was between  Nantes and  L'orient.   100      Johnson is in favour of  Nantes.

[Henri] 4. which  I was told by the Abbey Reynalle.
697,1779-04-26,There is a Feebleness and a Languor in my Nature. My Mind and Body both  partake of this Weakness. By my Physical Constitution I am but an ordinary  Man. The Times alone have destined me to Fame -- and even these have not been  able to give me much. When I look in the Glass my Eye my Forehead my Brow  my Cheeks my Lips all betray this Relaxation. Yet some great Events some  cutting Expressions some mean Scandals Hypocrisies have at Times  thrown this Assemblage of Sloth Sleep and littleness into Rage a little like  a Lion. Yet it is not like the Lion -- there is Extravagance and Distraction in  it that still betrays the same Weakness.  s 106 - 264  [ No s available ]  [ s 106-264 contain many nineteenth century s of  entries from 's earlier diaries.

He thinks one Consul enough for  the Kingdom with Power of Deputation. This that a Duty of so much per Ton on  all Ships entering a french Port for the Relief of unfortunate Americans  Prisoners   3      Shipwrecked Persons &c. That no Man should be  discharged from a Ship but by the Consul. That six ten or twelve Merchants  should be appointed to inspect the Consuls accounts once in 3 Months  c.
699,1779-05-07,This Evening arrived Capt. Jones from  Baltimore. He sailed 28 March -- brings no News Papers nor News.  No Dispatches from Congress. No Letters but to Mr. Johnson  and a Packet for  Bourdeaux.
700,1779-05-09,This Gentleman has been disappointed in Love and in his Ambition --  disappointed in the Promotion to which he aspired and in a Marriage of which  he thought himself sure. He has not so much Activity Dispatch and Decision as  [one?] could wish. He seems not to know how to gain or preserve  the Affections of his Officers nor yet how to keep them in Awe. Complaisance  firmness and Steadiness are necessary to the Command of a Ship. Whether it is  his imperfect Knowledge of the Language or his Absence of Mind when poring  upon his Disappointments or any defect in his Temper or judgment I know not  but this happy Mixture seems to be wanting. His Lieutenants are smart Men  quick and active -- not lettered it is true but good Seamen and brave.
701,1779-05-10,When I arrive I must enquire -- concerning  Congress Ennemys Army  R.I.  N.Y.  G. [Georgia] our Army our Currency  Mass. Bay  Boston &c.

704,1779-05-13,Excentricities and Irregularities are to  be expected from him -- they are in his Character they are visible in his  Eyes. His Voice is soft and still and small his Eye has keenness and Wildness  and Softness in it.
705,1779-05-14,Mr. Gimaet came on  board to visit me Aid de Camp of the  Marquis de la Fayette.
706,1779-05-15,Coll. Wuibert tells a story. That at  Angers a Bishop has been found unconsumed and uncorrupted after  being buried many Years. They buried him up again and is to be dug up again  after a certain time and if found entire is to be made a saint. His  Preservation is to be a Miracle whereas the Truth is there is salt where he  lies. This the Coll. calls  Sottise.
707,1779-05-16,My Son could not comprehend why they should  be so fond of Iron. He was told that Iron made the principal Difference between  savage and civilised Nations. That all Arts and  Manufactures depended upon Iron &c.
708,1779-05-17,I said the Roman Lawyers were good Writers. Justinians  Institutes were pure as Classicks. Several French  Lawyers had been fine Writer as Cochin &c. and  some English Lawyers as Bacon Clarendon  Couper Blackstone. But it was a common  Observation in  England and I found it as common in  Paris that Lawyers were generally bad Writers.

710,1779-05-19,This of  L'orient is a fine Port and Harbour.  Men of War can come up to the Wharf and they commonly lie not far from it. But  there is no such pleasant Prospects of the Country as in  Boston Harbour.   22

713,1779-05-22,This Man has a Littleness in his Mien and Air. His face is small and sharp.  So that you form a mean Opinion of him from the first Sight. Yet his Eye is  good. He maintained a good Character among the American Prisoners and you find  by close Conversation with him that he has a good deal in him of Knowledge.
714,1779-05-23,There are many Protestants here who ne croient pas rien. Ils sont  Athe.

718,1779-06-08,Landais has torn open the old Sore and in my Opinion has  now ruined the Peace of this Ship.   28      He has  [an] unhappy Mind. He must ever have something to complain  of -- something to peave and fret about. He is  jealous.

723,1779-06-19,Our Captain at length laid too hoisted his  Colours and fired a Gun as a Challenge. One of them  hoisted English Colours and fired a Gun which I  suppose was accepting the Challenge. Our Captain gave her two Broad Sides for  the Sake of exercising his Men and some of his Balls went beyond her some  before and some behind her. I cannot say that any one hit but there were two  which went so well that it is possible they might. It is certain they were  frightened for upon our wearing to give her chase all 4 of them were about in  an Instant and run. -- But at Evening there were several others in Sight.
724,1779-06-20,Mr. Marbois upon this said it would be easy in  France to produce an Orator equal to  Bolinbroke. I asked who? John Jac.  [Jacques?] -- No Malesherbes.  Malesherbes Orations might be placed on a Footing with  Demosthenes and Cicero.
725,1779-06-21,I find a Gentleman in the Suit of the Chevalier in  the Character of Interpreter and English Master who has written a large Volume  upon English Pronunciation and Accent. His Name is  Carr.
726,1779-06-22,In the Evening I fell into Chat with the Chevalier.  He asked me about Governeur Morris. I  said it was his Christian Name -- that he was not Governor. The Chevalier said  He had heard of him as an able Man. I said he was a young Man chosen into  Congress since I left it. That I had sat some Years with his Elder Brother in  Congress. That Governeur was a  Man of Wit of and made pretty Verses -- but of a Character  trs legere.   50      That the Cause of  America had not been sustained by such Characters as that of  Governor Morris or his Colleague Mr. Jay who  also was a young Man about 30 and not quite so solid as his  Predicessor Mr. Laurence  [Laurens] upon whose Resignation in the sudden  Heat Mr. Jay was chosen. That Mr. Lawrence  had a great landed Fortune free from Debt that he had long Experience in  public life and an amiable Character for Honour And  Probity. That he is between 50 and 60 Years of Age.
727,1779-06-23,Mr. M. asked are natural Children admitted in  America to all Priviledges like  Children born in Wedlock. -- I answered they are not Admitted to the Rights of  Inheritance. But their fathers may give them Estates by Testament and they are  not excluded from other Advantages. -- In  France said M.M. they are not admitted into  the Army nor any Office in Government. -- I said they were not excluded from  Commissions in the Army Navy or State but they were always attended with a  Mark of Disgrace. -- M.M. said this No doubt in Allusion to  Mr. Fs. natural Son and natural Son of a natural Son. I let  myself thus freely into this Conversation being led on   53      naturally by  the Chevalier and Mr. Marbois on  Purpose because I am sure it cannot be my Duty nor the Interest of my Country  that I should conceal any of my sentiments of this Man at the same Time that I  due Justice to his Merits. It would be worse than Folly  to conceal my Opinion of his great Faults.
728,1779-06-24,The Chevalier de la Luzerne said I is of an high  Family. -- Yes said Mr. Marbois he is of an  ancient Family who have formerly had in it Cardinals and Marechalls of  France but not lately.

731,1779-07-02,It is true said the Chev.  [Chevalier] -- our Court at some Periods of our  History have mis beaucoup de Ruses dans leur Politique. But this had never any  better Effect than to make Us distrusted by all Mankind.   61    
732,1779-07-04,I returned Compliments to the Chevr. and the  Gentlemen and Thanks for their kind Congratulations on my Countries  Independence and sincerely wished as this was the foundation of the happy  Alliance between  France and  America that the latest Posterity of both Countries might have  Reason to rejoice in it.   62

On y voioit un chef qui n'etoit proprement que  le premier des Citoiens et qui donnoit moins des ordres que des Conseils. Les Grands qui jugeoient les  Procs de leur district et commandoient les Troupes etoient choisis  comme les rois dans les assemblees generales. Cent Personnes prises dans la  Multitude servoient de Surveillans a chaque comte et de chefs aux differens  hameaux. La nation entiere toit en quelque Sorte une Arme  toujours Sur pied.

744,1779-12-07,Yesterday the Chevr. de la Molion gave me some Nuts which  he call'd Noix d'Acajou. They are the same which I  have often seen and which were called Cooshoo Nuts.  The true name is Acajou Nuts. They are shaped like our large white Beans. The  outside Shell has an Oil in it that is corrosive caustic or burning. In  handling one of these Shells enough to pick out the meat I got a little of this  oyl on my fingers and afterwards inadvertently rubbing  my Eyes especially my Left I soon found the Lids swelled and inflamed up to  my Eyebrow.

751,1779-12-16,There are in this Town Three Convents of Monks and two of Nuns. One of the  Nunneries is of Capuchins very austere. The Girls eat no meat wear no  linnen sleep on the floor never on a bed their faces  are always covered up with a Veil and they never speak to any Body.   16    
752,1779-12-17,Drank Tea with the Consul. The Attorney General was there and Mr.  Logoanere and the Captain of the french Frigate the  [Belle Poule.]   18    
753,1779-12-18,Went into the Church of a Convent found them all upon their Knees chanting  the Prayers to the Virgin it being the Eve of the Ste. Vierge. The Wax Candles  lighted by their Glimmerings upon the Paint and Gilding made a pretty  Appearance and the Music was good.   19

755,1779-12-20,Went to the Audiencia where We saw the four judges setting in their Robes  the Advocates in theirs a little below and the Attorneys lower down still. We  heard a Cause argued. The Advocates argued sitting used a great deal of Action  with their Hands and Arms and spoke with Eagerness. But the Tone of oratory  seemed to be wanting.   22    
756,1779-12-22,The Administrator gave me a Map of  Gibraltar and the Spanish Ships about it by Sea and Lines by  Land.   24

759,1779-12-26,At half after two We mounted our Carriages and Mules and rode four Leagues  to  Betanzos the ancient Capital of the Kingdom of  Gallicia and the Place where the Archives are still kept. We  saw the Building a long Square stone Building without any Roof opposite the  Church. There are in this Place two Churches and two Convents. The last League  of the Road was very bad mountainous and rocky to such a degree as to be very  dangerous. Mr. Lagoanere did Us the Honour to bear Us company to this Place. It would appear  romantick to describe the House the Beds and the  People.
760,1779-12-27,Baa monde.   28    
761,1779-12-28,Mr. Lagoanere told Us that the Original of the affair of  St. Iago was this. A Shepherd saw a bright Light there in the  night. Afterwards it was revealed to an Archbishop that St.  James was buried there. This laid the foundation of a Church and they  have built an Altar on the Spot where the Shepherd saw the Light. Some time  since the People made a Vow that if the Moors should be driven from this  Country they would give so much of the Income of their Lands to St. James. The  Moors were driven away and it was reported that St. James was in the Battle on  Horse back with a drawn Sword and the People fulfilled their Vows by Paying  the Tribute but lately a Duke of Alva a Descendant of  the famous Duke has refused to pay for his Estate which has occasioned a Law  suit which is carried by Appeal to Rome. The Duke attempted to prove that  St. James was never in  Spain. The Pope has suspended it. This  looks like a Ray of Light. Upon the Supposition that this is the Place of the  Sepulture of St. James there are great Numbers   31      of  Pilgrims who visit it every Year from  France  Spain  Italy and other Parts of  Europe many of them on foot.  St. Iago is called the Capitol of  Galicia because it is the Seat of the Archbishop and because  St. James is its Patron but  Corunna is in fact the Capital as it is the Residence of the  Governor the Audience &c. &c.
762,1779-12-30,We are obliged in this journey to carry our own Beds Blanketts Sheets Pillows &c. our own Provisions of  Chocolat Tea Sugar Meat Wine Spirits and  every Thing that We want.

He resides in  Madrid and receives about sixty thousand Ducats or about  thirty thousand dollars a Year of Rent from the Tenants partly in cash and  partly in Grain. He has a Secretary and some other Agents who reside at  Leon to collect his Rents. The Grandees of  Spain all reside at  Madrid. Former Kings in order to break up the Barons Wars  called all the Nobles to Court and gave them Employments.    [  --  ]
770,1780-01-07,I have not seen a Chimney in  Spain except one of the french Consul at  Corunna. One or two half Imitations of Chimneys in the Kitchens  are all that I have seen.

No forrest or Timber or fruit trees. Scarcely any fences  except a few mud Walls for Sheep folds.   5    
772,1780-01-11,We passed through several Villages this day and rode along a River and  arrived at  Bribiesca. The Country a little more hilly than for some time  past. But it has a naked and poor Appearance.   10    
773,1780-01-12,A Spanish Kitchen is one of the greatest Curiosities in the World and they  are all very much alike.   11

775,1780-01-14,It was a vexatious Thing to see the beautifull  Valley of  Orduna devoured by so many Hives of Drones. It is a  beautifull a fertile and a well cultivated Spot  almost the only one We have yet seen in  Biscay capable of Cultivation.

777,1780-01-16,Reposed and wrote.
778,1780-01-17,The Lands in  Biscay are chiefly in the Hands of the People -- few Lordships.  The Duke of Berwick and the Duke of Medina  Cli have some Estates here but not considerable. In the  Spring Freshes the Water is deep enough upon Change and in the Streets for  Vessells of 100 Tons to float.   20    
779,1780-01-18,Spent the Day in Walking about the Town. Walked round the Wharf upon the  River through the Market.

He very much admired my  House and its Situation. I said smiling it was very well for a Beginning and  that I hoped We should have an House at  Stockholm e'er long. He smiled in  return but said nothing. His Visit was not long. There is not a more sensible  manly happy or prudent Countenance in the whole Diplomatick Body. He has desired  Mr. Dumas to inform him  as soon as the Treaty is signed that he may write itt to  his Court before it arrives in the News papers.   8

He seemed much affected  Said all  Europe would laugh at them and that they deserved it for  attempting   12      a Thing so evidently impossible. -- No Governments say  he but Monarchies are subject to this kind of Misfortunes from absurdity. In  France a Madame Pompadour or de  Barry may ruin Kingdom. In  Spain an absurd Prist Priest the Father Confessor of  a superstitious King may so far gain his Confidence by working upon his  conscience and superstitious Fears as to lead him into such foolish Councils.  -- How much Mischief says I has  Spain done in this just Cause.
794,1782-10-03,Answer. The Council of State and the Council of Commissioners are two  distinct Bodies. -- De Raad van Staaten en de Gecommitteerde Raaden. -- The 1.  is for the 7 Prov. -- the last for the Province of  Holland only.   16  [  -- ]

806,1782-10-17,Began my journey to  Paris from the  Hague dined at  Harlem and drank Tea at five O Clock at  Amsterdam. Paid Mr. Bromfield 200 Ducats 1050  Guilders and took his Receipt upon Account... Met Mr. Willink  upon the Road going to the  Hague with a Lady. He has left for me a Letter of Credit upon  Paris unlimited. He wished my journey to  Paris might have a Tendency towards Peace.
807,1782-10-18,It is 8 hours Stones or Leagues from  Amsterdam to  Utrecht. The  Village of Suylen and its  Neighbourhood is full of Brick  Killns. The Clay is found in that Neighborhood and  they burn the Bricks with Turf Wood and Coal. Put up at  Utrecht at the  New Castle of Antwerp which is now kept by  Oblet who speaks English very well altho born at  Leyden. The  grand Canal which runs through this Town is a great Curiosity.  The paved Street upon each Side of it is a covered Way or rather the Cover  of a Cellar. The Cellars of the Houses are all continued out under this Paved  Street to the Canal. And there are Doors through which Men pass from the  Canal under the Street into the Cellars of the Houses and a contra from the  Cellars to the Canal and the Boats Barks or Schuits in it. The city maintains  the Pavement but the Vaults underneath are maintained by the  Proprietors.Oblet tells me that the Spanish and Prussian  Ambassadors were here a few days ago. Came in an hired Carriage. That  Lord Stormont and his Lady were once here. Travelled  only with 2 Men Servants. Very near. My Lady had not so much as a Maid with  her.Peterson is much hated.Oostergo makes a  damned noise to day about the fleets not going to  Brest.
808,1782-10-19,The 4 last Leagues being Sand were tolerable but the former 4 being Clay  were very bad -- muddy and deep.
809,1782-10-20,This Evening all the Carriages of the Town were parading in the  place de Mier full of Ladies and Gentlemen as on the  Boulvards at  Paris.
810,1782-10-21,The Gate was shut before our Arrival. The Porter demanded my Name and  Quality in order to send them to a Burgomaster of the City for a Billet du  Porte. The Messenger returned with an order to admit  Mr. Adams Minister Plenipotentiaire  des Etats Unis &c. in stronger terms than usual. I did not know but the  Burgomaster would have omitted the Quality in the order. But I am told that  every body here is American.
811,1782-10-22,We set off on our journey about Twelve but before We reached  Halle the Iron Axletree of our fore  Weels snapped off like a Piece of Glass our Carriage fell and We were put to  great difficulty to drag it to the  Porte Verde a Tavern in this Village. Being thus detained for  the Reparation of our Carriage after Dinner We walked about the Village and  visited the  Church of Notre Dame de Halle but saw nothing but what is very  common. The Village is dirty and poor.... What a Contrast to the Villages of  Holland.
812,1782-10-23,All the Cities and Villages of  Brabant are very different from those of  Holland. The Streets very foul. The Houses very dirty the Doors  and Windows broken Bricks and Glass wanting. The People Men Women and  Children filthy and ragged.
813,1782-10-24,Dined at  Cambray visited the Cathedral saw the Tomb of  Fenelon his Statue Picture &c. Saw the Chapter where the  Chanoines meet twice a Week and saw also the   31      Room where are the  Portraits of all the Archbishops and Bishops ancient and Modern and  Fenelon among the rest. There is also in this Church a curious  Piece of Clock Work which represents the whole Proscess with Jesus Christ like that in  the  7 Chappells of Mount Calvare. --  Lodged at  Peronne.
814,1782-10-25,The Ecchoing horn  The ecchoing horn calls the Sportsmen abroad  To horse my brave Boys and away  The morning is up and the Cry of the hounds  Upbraids our too tedious Delay.  What Pleasure We find in pursuing the Fox  O'er hills and o'er Valleys he flies  Then follow W'ell soon overtake him. Huzza  The Traitor is seized on and dies.  Tryumphant returning at night with our  Spoils  Like Bacchanals shouting and gay  How Sweet with a Bottle and Lass to refresh  And loose the Fatigues of the Day.  With Sport Love and Wine fickle Fortune defy  Dull Wisdom all Happiness sours  Since Life is no more than a Passage at best  Let's strew the Way over with Flowers.   32    
817,1782-10-27,R. is still full of Js. Firmness and Independance. Has taken upon himself to act without  asking Advice or even communicating with  the C. [Comte] de  V. [Vergennes] -- and this even in opposition to  an Instruction. This Instruction which is alluded to in a Letter I received  at the Hague a few days before I left it has never yet been  communicated to me. It seems to have been concealed designedly from me. The  Commission to W. was urged to be filled up as soon as the Commission came  to O. [Oswald] to treat  with the Mins. [Ministers] of  the united States and it is filled up and signed. W. has lately  been very frequently with J. at his house and has been very desirous of  perswading F. to live in the same house with J. -- Between two as subtle  Spirits as any in this World the one malicious the other I think honest I  shall have a delicate a nice a critical Part to Act. F.s cunning will be to  divide Us. To this End he will provoke he will insinuate he will intrigue he  will maneuvre. My Curiosity will at least be  employed in observing his Invention and his Artifice. J. declares roundly that  he will never set his hand to a bad Peace. Congress may appoint another but he  will make a good Peace or none.   4    
818,1782-10-28,Dined with Mr. Allen.

823,1782-11-02,Almost every Moment of this Week has been employed in Negotiation with the  English Gentlemen concerning Peace. We have made two Propositions. One the  Line of forty five degrees. The other a Line thro the  Middles of the Lakes. And for the Bound between  Mass. and  Nova Scotia -- a Line from  the Mouth of St. Croix to its Source and from its Source to the  high Lands.   5    
824,1782-11-03,No says the Cat: I wont let go and fall you shall stoop and set me  down.
825,1782-11-05,Oswald talks of Pultney and a Plott to divide  America between  France and England.  France to have  N. England. They tell a Story about Vergennes and his agreeing that the English might propose  such a division but reserving a Right to deny it all. These Whispers ought not  to be credited by Us.
826,1782-11-09,I went out to  Passy to dine with Mr. F. who had been  to  Versailles and presented his Memorial and the Papers  accompanying it. The C. said he would have the Papers  translated to lay them before the King but the Affair would meet with many  Difficulties. F. brought the same Message to me from  the C. and said he believed it would be taken kindly  if I went. I told both the Marquis and  the Dr. that I would go tomorrow Morning.
827,1782-11-10,Compliments are the Study of this People and there is no other so ingenious  at them.   16    
828,1782-11-11,We had more Conversation on the State of Manners in  France  EnglandScotland and in other Parts of  Europe but I have not Time to record this.   20    
829,1782-11-12,The Abby Arnoux asked me at Table Monsieur ou est  votre Fils Cadet qui chant come Orphe. -- Il est du retour en  Amerique. -- To Mademoiselle Labhard he said Connoissez vous que Monsieur  Adams a une Demoiselle tres aimable en Amerique?
830,1782-11-13,This is the Anniversary of my quitting home. Three Years are  compleated. Oh when shall I return?  --Ridley dined with me. Captain Barney called  in the Evening and took my dispatches. One set he is to deliver to  Capt. Hill another to  Capt.  and the 3d he takes himself.
831,1782-11-17,How says I will an independant Man in one of  our Assemblies consider this. We will take a Man who is no Partisan of  England or  France one who wishes to do justice to both and to all Nations  but is the Partisan only of his own.  [ This entry continues in John  Adams  36. ]
833,1782-11-18,Thank you for your good Will says I which I feel to be sincere. But Nations  dont feel as you and I do and your nation when it gets a little refreshed from  the fatigues of the War when Men and Money are become plenty and Allies at  hand will not feel as it does now. We never can be such damned Sots says he as  to think of differing again with you. -- Why says I in truth I have never been  able to comprehend the Reason why you ever thought of differing with Us.   11    
834,1782-11-19,If the Britons should strike with Us I would agree with you   13      after the terms are signed to advise to the Measure. If I were  the King of G. Britain I would give Orders to all my  Ambassadors at the Neutral Courts to announce to those Courts the Independence  of  America that I had acknowledged it and given a Commission  under the Great Seal to treat with the Ministers of the  United States of America. That I recommended to these Courts to  follow the Example and open Negotiations with the said  United States. That I recommended to those  neutral States to send their Vessells  freely to and receive Vessells freely from all the  Ports of the  United States. I would send the Earl of  Effingham Ambassador to Congress instructed to assure them that I  would no do them my best Offices to secure to them the  Fisheries their Extent to  the Missisippi and the Navigation of that River. That I  would favour all their Negotiations  in Europe upon their own Plan of making commercial Treaties with  all Nations. That I would interpose my good offices with the Barbary States to  procure them Mediterranean Passes &c.
835,1782-11-20,Today I received a Letter from my Excellent Friend Mr. Laurens 12 Nov.London in  answer to mine of the 6. agreeing as speedily as possible to join his  Colleagues. Thank God I had a Son who dared to die for his Country!   21    
836,1782-11-21,Ridley and Bancroft came in and spent the  Evening. B. says that Mr. Oswald dont  feel very well that he thinks of going home. That the K. will bring in some of  the old Minsters &c.
837,1782-11-22,I said I wondered that Mr. Fox had not sent over some  Friend here during the Conferences to pick up what he could of Intelligence.  But upon Recollection I said his Friends  RichmondKeppell Townsend  Cambden &c. were in the Council and Cabinet and therefore  no doubt informed him of all Intelligence and let him into all the Secret of  Affairs.  [ This entry continues in   37. ]
839,1782-11-23,Spent part of the Evening at Mrs. Izards.  Mr. Oswald sent for Jay desired to meet him at either house. Mr. Jay went and I came off.   3    
840,1782-11-25,Bancroft came in this Evening and said it was reported  that a Courier had arrived from Mr. Rayneval in  London and that after it the C. de  Vergennes told the King that he had the Peace in his Pocket. That  he was now Master of the Peace.
841,1782-11-26,The rest of the Day was spent in endless Discussions about the Tories.  Dr. F. is very staunch against the Tories more  decided a great deal on this Point than Mr. Jay or  my self.   12    
842,1782-11-27,Dined with Mr. Jay and spent some time before  Dinner with him and Dr. Franklin and all the  Afternoon and Evening with them and Mr.  Oswald endeavouring to come together concerning the Fisheries and  Tories.
843,1782-11-28,That the Subjects of his Britannic Majesty and the People of the  said United States shall continue to enjoy unmolested the  Right to take Fish of every kind on  the Grand Bank and on all the other  Banks of Newfoundland: also in the  Gulph of St. Laurence and in all other  Places where the Inhabitants of both Countries used at any time heretofore to  fish and the Citizens of the said United States shall have Liberty to cure and  dry their Fish on the  Shores of Cape Sables and of any of the unsettled Bays Harbours or Creeks of  Nova Scotia or any of the  Shores of the Magdalene Islands and of the  Labradore Coast: And they shall be permitted in Time of Peace to  hire Pieces of Land for Terms of Years of the legal Proprietors in any of the  Dominions of his said Majesty whereon to erect the necessary Stages and  Buildings and to cure and dry their Fish.   13    
844,1782-11-29,Mr. Jay spoke up and said it could not be a  Peace it would only be an insidious Truce without it.
845,1782-11-30,I have not attempted in these Notes to do justice to the Arguments of my  Colleagues both all of whom were throughout the whole  Business when they attended very attentive and very able especially  Mr. Jays to whom the French would if  they knew as much of his negotiations as they do of mine would very justly  give the Title with which they have inconsiderately decorated me that of Le  Washington de la Negotiation a very flattering Compliment indeed to which I  have not a Right but sincerely think it belongs to Mr.  Jay.   24  [  -- ]
846,1782-12-01,Made many Visits &c.
847,1782-12-03,In the Evening many Gentlemen came in among the rest Mi  Bourse the Agent of the Dutch East India Company who expressed a  good deal of Anxiety about their Negotiation and feared they should not have  justice in  the East Indies.
848,1782-12-04,I hope it will be permitted to me or to some other who can do it better some  Ten or fifteen Years hence to collect together in one View my little  Negotiations in  Europe. Fifty Years hence it may be published perhaps 20. I  will venture to say however feebly I may have acted my  Part or however whatever Mistakes I may have committed yet  the Situations I have been in between angry Nations and more angry actions  have been some of the most singular and interesting that ever happened to any  Man. The Fury of Ennemies as well as of  Elements the Subtilty and Arrogance of  Allies and what has been worse than all the jealousy Envy and little Pranks  of Friends and CoPatriots would form one of the most instructive Lessons in  Morals and Politicks that ever was committed to  Paper.   7    
849,1782-12-05,Dined at Mr. Jays with Mr.  Fitsherbert Oswald Franklin Laurens and their  SecretariesEllis Whitefoord Franklin and Laurens. Mr.  Jennings was there too he came home and spent the Evening with  me.

853,1782-12-09,Give me leave to tell you Sir says I you are mistaken. If I have not been  mistaken in the Policy of  France from my first Observation of it to this hour they have  been as averse to other Powers acknowledging our Independence as you have been.  -- Mr. Jay joined me in the same Declaration. -- God!  says he I understand it now. There is a Gentleman going to  London this day. I will go home and write upon the Subject by  him.
854,1782-12-10,1. The Liberty of Navigation. 2. That no Forts shall be built or Garrisons  maintained upon any of the Frontiers in  America nor upon any of the Land Boundaries. 3.

Agreed that Mr. Jay and I should prepare a joint Letter to Congress. At  7. I met Mr. Jay at his House and We drew a  Letter.   16    
857,1782-12-13,which I carried first to Mr. Laurens who made some  Corrections and Additions and then to  Passy to Dr. Franklin who proposed a  few other Corrections and shewed me an Article he  has drawn up for the definitive Treaty to exempt Fishermen Husbandmen and  Merchants as much as possible from the Evils of future Wars. This is a good  Lesson to Mankind at least. All agreed to meet at my House at 11 tomorrow to  finish the joint Letter.
858,1782-12-16,Mr. Fitsherbert and Mr. OswaldMr.  Laurens &c. dined with me
859,1782-12-17,We met at Mr. Laurens's at Dr. Franklins  Summons or Invitation at 11 O Clock. He produced a Letter to him from  the Comte de Vergennes and a Project of an  Answer which he had drawn up which We advised him unanimously to send.   17    
860,1782-12-19,Mr. L. told me this Morning that the Salt Pits in  England are directly under the  River Dee and that Ships sail over the Heads of the Workmen. Bay  Salt is such as is made in  France and  Spain round the  Bay of Biscay. Rock Salt from Saltertudas.   18    
861,1782-12-20,Dined with Mr. Laurens.
862,1782-12-21,Mr. Jay is uneasy about the French Troops in  America -- afraid that more are going and that they will  overawe our Councils.

863,1782-12-22,Made several Visits &c.
864,1782-12-23,Received from Monsieur Geoffroy Docteur Regent de la  Faculte de Medicine de Paris a Letter of Thanks from the Societe  Royale de Medecine for my Letter to him proposing a Correspondence between  that Society and the Medical Society at Boston. Made several  Visits. &c. Went to the Italian Comedy saw Les Troqueurs the two  Harlequins &c.
865,1782-12-24,There are Men who carry the Countenance and Air of Boys through Life. This  Evening Mr. Jay told me an extraordinary Story of  Lord Mount Steuart the British Minister at  Turin which he had from Mr.  Oswald.
866,1782-12-26,Mr. Vaughan shew 'd me  to day a parcel of new French Books. Le Systeme  naturelle Le Systeme moral Le Systeme Social Le Systeme Politique. There is  one Shop tolerated in selling forbidden Books. -- Vaughan has  a Brother in  Philadelphia who has written him a long Letter about the  Constitutionists and the Republicans. They have chosen Mr.  Dickinson Governor and Mr. Mifflin into  Congress.   23  [  --  ]   24  [  -- ]
867,1783-01-01,The same day I called upon Mr. Jay and asked him  to speak with Mr. Oswald upon the same  Subject called next upon Mr. Laurens and mentioned the same  Idea to him called at Mr. Oswalds to  talk with him upon it but he was gone out.
868,1783-01-05,Dined with M. Vaughan in Company with the Abby de  Mably Chalut Arnoux and Ter  Saint [Tersan]. -- Had more Conversation  with de Mably than at any Time before. He meditates a Work upon  our American Constitutions. He says the Character he gives of Herodian in his  last Work Sur la maniere d'ecrire L'histoire has procured to his Bookseller  Purchases for all the Copies of that Historian which he had in his  Shop.Arnoux said that Rousseau by his  Character of Robinson Crusoe helped his Bookseller to the Sale of an whole  Edition of that Romance in a few days.
869,1783-01-11,This Letter and other Circumstances convince me that the Plan is laid  between the C. de Vergennes and the Dr. to  get Billy made Minister to this Court and not improbably the  Dr. to  London. Time will shew.
870,1783-01-12,Mr. Vaughan said this was very important Information and  entirely new. That he [  ] was much enlightened and had  Sentiments upon the Occasion. That he would write it to the E. of  Shelburne and his Lordship would make great Use of it without  naming me &c.
871,1783-01-13,I told him what I told Yesterday to Vaughan and gave him  some short Account of my Correspondence with the C. de  Vergennes upon the Question whether I should communicate  to Lord G. Germain my Commissions and his Requisition  from the King not to do it &c.   8    
872,1783-01-19,Received a Note from Mr. Franklin that  the C. de Vergennes had written to him to desire  me to meet him at his office tomorrow at ten. Went out  to Passy told Mr. Franklin that I had  been informed last night that the Comte was  uneasy at Mr. Oswalds going away because  he expected to sign the Preliminaries in a day or two.
873,1783-01-20,Returned to  Paris and dined with the  Duchess D'Anville and the Duke de la  Rochefaucault.
874,1783-01-21,The King appeared in high Health and in gay Spirits: so did the  Queen.M. [Madame] Elizabeth is grown  very fat. The C. D'Artois seems very well. Mr. Fitsherbert had his first Audience of  the King and Royal Family and dined for the first time with the Corps  Diplomatique.   10    
875,1783-01-23,I told him the Story of my Correspondence with the C. de  Vergennes in 1780 about communicating my Mission to Lord  G. Germain. He said if I had followed my own Opinion and written  to his Lordship and published the Letter it would have turned out the old  Ministry. I told him I was restrained by a Requisition from the King. Besides  the Defeat of D'Estaing and Langara had  turned the Heads of the People of  England at that time.   11    
876,1783-02-18,I have been injured and my Country has joined in the Injury. It has basely  prostituted its own honour by sacrificing mine. But  the Sacrifice of me for my Virtues was not so servile and intollerable as putting Us all under Guardianship.  Congress surrendered their own Sovereignty into the Hands of a French Minister.  Blush blush! Ye guilty Records! blush and perish! It is Glory to have broken  such infamous orders. Infamous I say for so they will be to all Posterity. How  can such a Stain be washed out? Can We cast a veil over it and forget it?   12    
877,1783-02-24,F. [Franklin] this Morning  mentioned to me the Voyage de la Fonte who mentions a Captain  Chapley and a Seymour Gibbons. F. thinks it is  translated from the Spanish and that the Translator or Printer has  put Seymour for Seignor. He had once a Correspondence about  this Voyage and Mr. Prince found there had been  a Captain Chapelet at  Charlestown and a Gibbons but not  named Seymour.
878,1783-02-25,He mentions a new Sort of Bark much redder and much stronger than any  known before.
879,1783-02-27,Spent the Evening in Company with the Abby de Mably some  other Abbys and Accademicians.   13      De Mably says There are in  France Three Orders of Citizens. The first Order is of the  Clergy. 2. The Second of the Nobility. 3. And the third is called Le Tiers  Etat. -- There are several Classes in the Order of the Clergy 7 or 8 Classes  in the Order of Nobles and Thirty Classes in the Tiers Etat. The Nobles all  believe that their Nobility is from God. And therefore the Nobles are all  equal and that the King cannot confer Nobility.
880,1783-03-07,With Regard to the fifth that respecting the Loyalists it would produce  much Evil. It would   14      It would totally defeat the Recommendations  which Congress were pledged to make in favour of the  Loyalists and put them in a worse Predicament than that they already stood in  by the Treaty. In order to support this Assertion Mr. Townsend  reasoned a good deal on the great danger arising at all times from creating  Jealousies and Suspicions in Parties negotiating but if there was any Party  more prone to jealousy any State more liable to catch Suspicion sooner than  another it must be the  United States of America on Account of their having been little  accustomed to the Business of negotiating and being obliged to trust  their first and dearest Interests in the hands of Persons of whose Fidelity  they had scarcely any pledge o f Security. Mr.  Townsend concluded with saying that for these Reasons he should  resist the fifth Resolution as well as the fourth.
881,1783-03-08,Chatelux said to the Abby Morlaix  that I was the Author of the  Massachusetts Constitution and that it was the best of em all  and that the People were very contented with it.   15    
882,1783-03-09,Dialogue sur les Bleds par L'Abbe Galliany.   18    
883,1783-04-27,Much Conversation passed which might as well have been spared. Mr.  Hartley was as copious as usual. I called on Mr.  Jay in the Evening and We agreed to meet at my House next Morning at  10.
884,1783-04-28,We drew together a Proposition for withdrawing the Troops opening the  Ports and quieting the Tories and went with it in my Carriage to Mr.  Laurens who thought it might do. I said to my Brothers I shall be  very ductile about Commerce. I would agree at once to a mutual Naturalization  or to the Article as first agreed on by Dr. F. and  Mr. Jay with Mr.  Oswald or I would agree to Mr. Hartleys Propositions  to let the Trade go on as before the War or as with Nova Scotia.  I could agree to any of these Things because that Time and the natural Course  of Things will produce a good Treaty of Commerce.  G.B. will soon see and feel the   19      Necessity of  alluring American Commerce to her Ports by Facilities and Encouragements of  every kind. We called at Mr. Hartleys  Hotel de York. He was out. At Mr.  Jays Mr. Hartley came in. We told him We thought of  making him a Proposition tomorrow and would meet him at Mr.  Laurens's at one. Wrote to Dr. Franklin and  W. T. Franklin desiring their Attendance at Mr.  Laurens's  Hotel de L'Empereur at 11. tomorrow. Received an Answer that  they would attend. Mr. Hartley desired of me Letters of  Introduction for Il Comte di Ferm a Cousin of  the Neapolitan Ambassader in London who is going to  America which I promised him and wrote in the Evening.
885,1783-04-29,At 11 We all met at Mr. Laurens's near the new French  Comedy and agreed upon a Proposition to open the Ports as soon as the  U. States should be evacuated. At one Mr.  Hartley came and We shewed it to him and  after some Conversation with him We agreed upon 3 Propositions. 1. To open the  Ports as soon as the States should be evacuated. 2. To set all confined Tories  at Liberty at the same time and 3. To set all Prisoners of War at Liberty upon  the same terms respecting the Accounts of their Expences as those between  France and  England.   20    
887,1783-04-30,He said his Commission would come as soon as the Courier could go and  return and that he would prepare his Propositions for the definitive Treaty  immediately. He said he had not imagined that We had been so  stout as he found Us. -- But he was very silent and attentive.  He has had hints I suppose from Laurens and Jay and Franklin too. He never  before discovered a Capacity to hearken. He ever  before took all the Talk to himself. I am not fond of talking but I wanted to  convey into his Mind a few Things for him to think upon. None of the English  Gentlemen have come here apprized of the Place  where their danger lay.   23    
888,1783-05-01,I told him he and I were in the same Case and explained to him my Situation  and gave him my frank Sentiments of a certain Minister. He said he was  veritablement touch.
889,1783-05-02,In Truth Congress and their Ministers have been plaid upon like Children trifled with imposed upon  deceived. Franklin's Servility and insidious  faithless Selfishness is the true and only Cause why this Game has succeeded.

The Furs which the Hudsons Bay Company sent to  London from the most northern Regions of America were sent to  Siberia within 150 Leagues of the Place where they were hunted.  He began to speak of La Fonte's Voyage and of the  Boston Story of Seymour or Seinior Gibbons but other Company  came in and interrupted the Conversation.
907,1783-06-18,The Duke said it would be very difficult to regulate  this Matter. They could not let Us bring their Sugars to  Europe neither to  France nor any other Part. This would lessen the Number of  French Ships and Seamen. But he thought We should be allowed to purchase Sugars  for our own Consumption. (How they will estimate the quantity and prevent our  exceeding it I know not.) He said there were Provinces in  France as  Guienne and  Provence which depended much upon supplying their Islands with  Provisions as Wheat and Flour &c. I asked him if We should be allowed to  import into their Islands Wheat Flour Horses Live Stock Lumber of all  Sorts Salt Fish &c. He said it would be bien difficile for Wheat and Flour  c.   9

They  are every where cutting up by the Roots the Elms  and other Forest Trees which formerly grew were planted on the  Sides of the Roads and introducing Apple Trees in their stead.

I am obliged here to give Thirteen  Shillings a day for a Parler a bed Chamber and  another Bed Chamber over it for my Son without any dining Room or Antichamber.  This is dearer than my Lodgings at the Hotel du Roi in  Paris -- half a Guinea for my bed Chamber and Parlour and half a Crown for my Sons bed Chamber. My  Servants Lodging is included in the half Guinea. The Rooms and Furniture are  more to my Taste than in  Paris because they are more like what I have been used to in  America.   10

Mailbois loved Money and demanded splendid  Appointments. He did not regard Money so much and would be easy about that. I  was the first Mortal to whom he had suggested the Idea he wished I would think  of it and he would call and see me again in a few days.   9    
925,1785-03-19,We came to no Resolution but that I should go Tomorrow to  Versailles and ask the Advice of  the C [Comte] de  V [Vergennes]. -- Dr. F. being  confined by his Stone could not go and Mr. Jefferson being  worse with his Disorder cannot go. I was for writing a Letter to the C. -- but  my Colleagues were not. -- F. and J. are confident that England has no right to  appoint a Consul without a Treaty or Convention for that Purpose. I think  they have a Right by the Law of Nations.   10    
926,1785-03-20,He asked if We had written to Congress and obtained their Instructions. I  told him We had received Full Powers to treat with  Morocco  Algiers  TunisTripoli and all the Rest and had written  for Instructions upon the Article of Money and Presents. He said that there was  a frequent Communication between  Marseilles and the  Coast of Barbary but that as these Things were not in his  Department We must state our Desires in Writing which I agreed to do. I asked  him if he thought it adviseable for Us to send any one to  Morro [Morrocco]. He said yes but as We could neither go nor  were authorized to substitute We should write to the Emperor untill Congress could send a Consull. I asked what he thought of our leaving it by our  Letter in the Option of the Emperor to send a Minister here to treat with Us  or to wait untill We could write to Congress and  recommend to them to send him a Consull. He said by  no means for the Expence of receiving his Minister  here would be much greater for We must maintain him and pay all his  Expences. He said that the King of  France never sent them any naval Stores. He sent them  Glaces and other Things of rich Value but never any  military stores.   12    
927,1785-05-03,One of the foreign Ambassadors said to me You have been often in  England. -- Never but once in November and December 1783.You  have Relations in  England no doubt. -- None at all. -- None how can that be? You  are of English Extraction? -- Neither my Father or Mother Grandfather or  Grandmother Great Grandfather or Great Grandmother nor any other Relation that  I know of or care a farthing for have been in  England these 150 Years. So that you see I have not one drop of  Blood in my Veins but what is American. -- Ay We have seen says he proofs  enough of that.

In the Evening other Company came  in according to the Fashion in this Country. Mrs. Shipley at  Table asked many Questions about the Expence of  living in  Philadelphia and Boston. Said she had a Daughter  who had married less prudently than they wished and they thought of sending  them to  America.

931,1786-03-30,Went at Nine O Clock to the French Ambassadors Ball where were two or three  hundred People chiefly Ladies. Here I met the Marquis of  Landsdown and the Earl of Harcourt. These  two Noblemen ventured to enter into Conversation with me. So did Sir  George Young [Yonge]. But there is an  Aukward Timidity in General. This People cannot  look me in the Face: there is conscious Guilt and Shame in their Countenances  when they look at me. They feel that they have behaved ill and that I am  sensible of it.   3    
932,1786-04-15,Dined with Mr. Brand Hollis in Chesterfield Street. His  Mantle Trees are ornamented with Antiques. Penates. Little brazen s of the  Gods. Venus Ceres Apollo Minerva &c.

935,1786-04-20,Osterly  Sion Place and  Sion Hill are all in  Brentford within Ten Miles of Hide Park Corner. We went  through Hide Park and  Kensington to  Brentford. We passed in going and returning by Lord  Hollands House which is a Modern Building in the gothic manner.
936,1786-04-23,Heard Dr. Priestley at Mr. Linseys in  Essex Street.
937,1786-04-24,Viewed the British Musaeum. Dr.  Grey who attended Us spoke very slightly of Buffon. Said he was full  of mauvais Fois. No Dependence upon him. Three out of four of his Quotations  not to be found. That he had been obliged to make it his Business to examine  the Quotations. That he had not found a quarter of them. That Linnxus was  quoted from early Editions long after the last Edition was public of 1766 the  12th which was inexcuseable. He did not think Buffon superiour to Dr. Hill. Both had  Imagination &c. -- This is partly national Prejudice and Malignity no  doubt.   12    
938,1786-06-26,On Saturday night returned from a Tour to  Portsmouth in which We viewed Paines Hill in  Surry as We went out and  Windsor as We returned. We were absent four days. Paines Hill is  the most striking Piece of Art that I have yet seen. The Soil is an heap of  Sand and the Situation is nothing extraordinary. It is a new Creation  of Mr. Hamilton. All made within 35  Years. It belongs to Mr. Hopkins who rides by it but never  stops. The owners of these enchanting Seats are very indifferent to their  Beauties. -- The Country from  Guilford to  Portsmouth is a barren heath a dreary Waste.   13    
939,1786-07-01,Copleys Fall of Chatham or Pierson Wests Wolf  Epaminondas Bayard &c. Trumbulls Warren and Montgomery are interesting  Subjects and useful. But a Million Pictures of Flours Game Cities Landscapes with whatever Industry  and Skill executed would be seen with much Indifference. The Sky the Earth  Hills and Valleys Rivers and Oceans Forrests  and Groves Towns and Cities may be seen at any Time.
940,1786-07-06,Mr. Pais told a Story admirably well of a Philosopher and  a Scotsman. The Wit attempted to divert himself by asking the Scot if he knew  the immense Distance to Heaven? It was so many Millions of Diameters of the  Solar System and a Cannon Ball would be so many Thousand Years in running  there. I dont know the Distance nor the Time says the Scot but I know it will  not take you a Millionth part of the Time to go to Hell. -- The Scottish  Dialect and Accent was admirably imitated. The Conversation was uniformly  agreable. Nothing to interrupt it.   15    
941,1786-07-08,In one of my common Walks along the Edgeware Road there are fine Meadows  or Squares of grass Land belonging to a noted Cow keeper. These  Plotts are plentifully manured. There are on the Side  of the Way several heaps of Manure an hundred Loads perhaps in each heap. I  have carefully examined them and find them composed of Straw and dung from the  Stables and Streets of  London mud Clay or Marl dug out of the Ditch along the  Hedge and Turf Sward cutt up with Spades hoes and  shovels in the Road. This is laid in vast heaps to mix. With narrow hoes they  cutt it down at each End and with shovels throw it into  a new heap in order to divide it and mix it more effectually. I have attended  to the Operation as I walked for some time. This may be good manure but is  not equal to mine which I composed in similar heaps upon my own Farm of Horse  Dung from Bracketts stable in  Boston Marsh Mud from the sea shore and Street Dust from the  Plain at the Foot of  Pens hill in which is a Mixture of Marl.   16    
942,1786-07-16,Mr. Langbourne of  Virginia who dined with Us on Fryday  at Col. Smiths dined here Yesterday. This Gentleman who is  rich has taken the Whim of walking all over  Europe after having walked over most of  America. His Observations are sensible and judicious. He walks  forty five or fifty miles a day. He says he has seen nothing  superiour to the Country from  N. York to  Boston. He is in Love with  N. England admires the Country and its Inhabitants. He kept  Company with the King of Frances Retinue in his late journey to Cherbourg.

It is at the End of the House and from two Windows in front and two others at  the End We have a pleasant View of Lawns and Glades Trees and Clumps and a  Piece of Water full of Fish. The Borders by the Walks in the Pleasure  Grounds are full of rare Shrubbs and Trees to which  Collection America has furnished her full Share. I shall here have a good  Opportunity to take a List of these Trees Shrubbs  and Flours.

946,1786-07-25,Mr. Hollis's Owl Cap of Liberty and Dagger are to be seen  every where. In the Boudoir a Silver cup with a  Cover all in the shape of an Owl with two rubies for Eyes. This piece of  Antiquity was dug up at Canterbury from ten feet depth. It was some monkish  conceit.
947,1786-07-26,Mr. B. Hollis Miss Brand Mrs.  Adams Mrs. Smith and I walked to Mill Green or  Mill Hill the Seat of a Mr. Allen a Banker of  London. We walked over the Pleasure Grounds and Kitchen Garden  and down to Cocytus a canal or Pond of Water surrounded with Wood in such a  Manner as to make the Place gloomy enough for the Name. This is a good Spot  but Mr. Allen has for want of Taste spoiled it by new  Pickett Fences at a great Expence. He has filled up the Ditches and dug up the  Hedges and erected wooden Fences and brick Walls a folly that I believe in  these days is unique. They are very good civil People but have no Taste.
948,1786-07-27,I should not omit Alderman Bridgens Nuns and Verses. About 30 Years  ago Mr. Bridgen in the  Austrian Netherlands purchased a compleat Collection of the Portraits of all the orders of  Nuns in small duodecimo Prints. These he lately sent as a Present  to the Hide and Mr. Hollis has placed them in what  he calls his Boudoir a little room between his Library and Drawing  Room.Mr. Bridgen carried down with him a Copy of Verses of his  own Composition to be hung up with them. The Idea is that banished from  Germany by the Emperor they were taking an Asylum at the Hide  in sight of the Druid the Portico of Athens and the verable 4 Remains of  Egyptian Greek Roman and Carthaginian Antiquities.

But I did not  affect this Character. I behaved with as much Prudence and Civility and  Industry as I could. But still it was a settled Point at Paris and in the  English News Papers that I was not the famous Adams and  therefore the Consequence was settled absolutely and unalterably that I was a  Man of whom Nobody had ever heard before a perfect Cypher a Man who did not understand a Word of French --  awkward in his Figure -- awkward in his Dress -- No Abilities -- a perfect  Bigot -- and fanatic.   92

960,1795-06-21,Lime dissolves all vegetable Substances such as Leaves Straws Stalks  Weeds and converts them into an immediate food for Vegetables. It kills the  Eggs of Worms and Seeds of Weeds. The best method is to spread it in your Barn  Yard among the Straw and Dung. It succeeds well when spread upon the Ground.  Burning Lime Stones or Shells diminishes their Weight: but slaking the Lime  restores that Weight. The German farmers say that Lime makes the father rich  but the Grandson poor -- i.e. exhausts the Land. This is all from Mr.  Rutherford. Plaister of Paris has a  vitriolic Acid in it which attracts the Water from the Air and operates like  watering Plants. It is good for corn -- not useful in wet Land. You sprinkle it  by hand as you sow Barley over the Ground 5 Bushells powdered to an [  ] Acre.  Carry it in a Bag as you would grain to sow.   29    
961,1795-06-22,Mr. Meredith at Mr. Vaughans explained to  me his Method. He takes a first Crop of Clover early: then breaks up the  Ground cross ploughs and harrows it. Then plants Potatoes. He only ploughs a  furrow drops the Potatoes a foot a sunder and then covers them with another  furrow. He ploughs now and then between these Rows: but never hoes. As soon as  the Season comes for sowing his Winter Barley: He diggs  the Potatoes ploughs and harrows the Ground sows the Winter Barley with  Clover Seeds and orchard Grass Seeds: and the next Spring he has a great Crop  of Barley and afterwards a great Burthen of Grass. --  He prefers Orchard Grass to Herds Grass as much more productive.   30  [  --  ]   31

The other  escaped. He told me too of another Event that vex'd provoked and  allarm 'd me much more -- vizt. That my Horses were  Yesterday in such   36      July 18 1796. Monday.  in  such a frenzy at the Church Door that they frightened the Crowd of People and  frightened a Horse or the People in the Chaise so that  they whipp'd their Horse till he ran over two Children. The  [  ] children stooped down or fell down so that the  chaise went over them without hurting them. But it  must have been almost a Miracle that they were not kill'd or wounded. I know not when my Indignation  has [been] more excited at the Coachman for his folly and  Carelessness: and indeed at others of the Family for the Carriage going to  Meeting at all. As Mrs. A. could not go the Coach ought not to have gone. The  Coachman and Footman ought to have gone to Meeting -- and the Girls to have  walk'd. L. Smith has no Pretentions to ride in a Coach more than Nancy  Adams or even Polly Howard. It is spoiling her Mind  and her Reputation both to indulge her Vanity in that Manner. I scolded at the  Coachman first and afterwards at his Mistress and I will scold again and  again. It is my Duty. There is no greater Insolence or Tyranny than sporting  with Horses and Carriages among Crouds of People.

We went up carried the Posts but when We came there We found  that the Wall was too heavy and Stones too large for two hands -- four at least  were necessary. Billings was wild and We came to some  Explanation. He must go off &c. Mrs. Adams paid  him off and then He thought he would not go.   39      July 21. 1796.  Thursday.  After long Conversations Billings  came to a Sort of Agreement to stay a Year from this day at 45. He  declared he would not drink Spirit nor Cyder for the  whole Year. He reserved however twelve days for himself. We shall see tomorrow  Morning how he behaves.

I  took a ride with him and in his Chaise to the Top of Penns Hill. If innate  Levity is curable they may be happy.   48      August 2. 1796. Tuesday.

997,1796-08-14,One great Advantage of the Christian Religion is that it brings the great  Principle of the Law of Nature and Nations Love your Neighbour as yourself and do to others as you would that  others should do to you to the Knowledge Belief and Veneration of the whole  People. Children Servants Women and Men are all Professors in the science of  public as well as private Morality. No other Institution for Education no kind  of political Discipline could diffuse this kind of necessary Information so  universally among all Ranks and Descriptions of Citizens. The Duties and Rights  of The Man and the Citizen are thus taught from early Infancy to every  Creature. The Sanctions of a future Life are thus added to the  Observance of civil and political as well as domestic and private Duties.  Prudence Justice Temperance and Fortitude are thus taught to be the means  and Conditions of future as well as present Happiness.

But I presume it may be made to produce Indian and English Grain  and English Grass especially Herdsgrass in Abundance.
